<p>The pages of this little book were in type and about to be
sent for correction to my sister&mdash;who had been for some
months in very delicate health&mdash;when she suddenly became
still more gravely ill.&nbsp; The hand which had traced the words
of love and veneration dedicated to our father&rsquo;s memory
grew too feeble to hold a pen, and before the proofs of her
little volume could be submitted to her for revision, my dear
sister died.</p>

</a></p>
<p>If, in these pages, written in remembrance of my father, I
should tell you my dear friends, nothing new of him, I can, at
least, promise you that what I shall tell will be told
faithfully, if simply, and perhaps there may be some things not
familiar to you.</p>
<p>A great many writers have taken it upon themselves to write
lives of my father, to tell anecdotes of him, and to print all
manner of things about him.&nbsp; Of all these published books I
have read but one, the only genuine &ldquo;Life&rdquo; thus far
written of him, the one sanctioned by my father himself, <!--
page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>namely: &ldquo;The Life of Charles Dickens,&rdquo; by
John Forster.</p>
<p>But in what I write about my father I shall depend chiefly
upon my own memory of him, for I wish no other or dearer
remembrance.&nbsp; My love for my father has never been touched
or approached by any other love.&nbsp; I hold him in my heart of
hearts as a man apart from all other men, as one apart from all
other beings.</p>
<p>Of my father&rsquo;s childhood it is but natural that I should
know very little more than the knowledge possessed by the great
public.&nbsp; But I never remember hearing him allude at any
time, or under any circumstances, to those unhappy days in his
life except in the one instance of his childish love and
admiration for &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill,&rdquo; which was destined
to become so closely associated with his name and works.</p>
<p>He had a very strong and faithful attachment for places:
Chatham, I think, being his first love in this respect.&nbsp; For
it was <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>here, when a child, and a very sickly child, poor little
fellow, that he found in an old spare room a store of books,
among which were &ldquo;Roderick Random,&rdquo; &ldquo;Peregrine
Pickle,&rdquo; &ldquo;Humphrey Clinker,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tom
Jones,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Vicar of Wakefield,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don
Quixote,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gil Blas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Robinson
Crusoe,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Arabian Nights,&rdquo; and other
volumes.&nbsp; &ldquo;They were,&rdquo; as Mr. Forster wrote,
&ldquo;a host of friends when he had no single
friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it was while living at Chatham that he
first saw &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a &ldquo;very queer small boy&rdquo; he used to walk up to
the house&mdash;it stood on the summit of a high hill&mdash;on
holidays, or when his heart ached for a &ldquo;great
treat.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would stand and look at it, for as a
little fellow he had a wonderful liking and admiration for the
house, and it was, to him, like no other house he had ever
seen.&nbsp; He would walk up and down before it with his father,
gazing at it with delight, and the latter would tell him that
perhaps if he <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>worked hard, was industrious, and
grew up to be a good man, he might some day come to live in that
very house.&nbsp; His love for this place went through his whole
life, and was with him until his death.&nbsp; He takes &ldquo;Mr.
Pickwick&rdquo; and his friends from Rochester to Cobham by the
beautiful back road, and I remember one day when we were driving
that way he showed me the exact spot where &ldquo;Mr.
Pickwick&rdquo; called out: &ldquo;Whoa, I have dropped my
whip!&rdquo;&nbsp; After his marriage he took his wife for the
honeymoon to a village called Chalk, between Gravesend and
Rochester.</p>
<p>Many years after, when he was living with his family in a
villa near Lausanne, he wrote to a friend: &ldquo;The green woods
and green shades about here are more like Cobham, in Kent, than
anything we dream of at the foot of the Alpine
passes.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, in still later years, one of his
favorite walks from &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill&rdquo; was to a
village called Shorne, where there was a <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>quaint old
church and graveyard.&nbsp; He often said that he would like to
be buried there, the peace and quiet of the homely little place
having a tender fascination for him.&nbsp; So we see that his
heart was always in Kent.</p>
<p>But let this single reference to his earlier years suffice, so
that I may write of him during those years when I remember him
among us and around us in our home.</p>
<p>From his earliest childhood, throughout his earliest married
life to the day of his death, his nature was home-loving.&nbsp;
He was a &ldquo;home man&rdquo; in every respect.&nbsp; When he
became celebrated at a very early age, as we know, all his joys
and sorrows were taken home; and he found there sympathy and the
companionship of his &ldquo;own familiar friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
his letters to these latter, in his letters to my mother, to my
aunt, and, later on, to us his children, he never forgot anything
that he knew would be of interest about his work, <!-- page
12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>his
successes, his hopes or fears.&nbsp; And there was a sweet
simplicity in his belief that such news would most certainly be
acceptable to all, that is wonderfully touching and child-like
coming from a man of genius.</p>
<p>His care and thoughtfulness about home matters, nothing being
deemed too small or trivial to claim his attention and
consideration, were really marvellous when we remember his
active, eager, restless, working brain.&nbsp; No man was so
inclined naturally to derive his happiness from home
affairs.&nbsp; He was full of the kind of interest in a house
which is commonly confined to women, and his care of and for us
as wee children did most certainly &ldquo;pass the love of
women!&rdquo; His was a tender and most affectionate nature.</p>
<p>For many consecutive summers we used to be taken to
Broadstairs.&nbsp; This little place became a great favorite with
my father.&nbsp; He was always very happy there, <!-- page
13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and
delighted in wandering about the garden of his house, generally
accompanied by one or other of his children.&nbsp; In later
years, at Boulogne, he would often have his youngest boy,
&ldquo;The Noble Plorn,&rdquo; trotting by his side.&nbsp; These
two were constant companions in those days, and after these walks
my father would always have some funny anecdote to tell us.&nbsp;
And when years later the time came for the boy of his heart to go
out into the world, my father, after seeing him off, wrote:
&ldquo;Poor Plorn has gone to Australia.&nbsp; It was a hard
parting at the last.&nbsp; He seemed to become once more my
youngest and favorite little child as the day drew near, and I
did not think I could have been so shaken.&nbsp; These are hard,
hard things, but they might have to be done without means or
influence, and then they would be far harder.&nbsp; God bless
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When my father was arranging and rehearsing his readings from
&ldquo;Dombey,&rdquo; the <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>death of
&ldquo;little Paul&rdquo; caused him such real anguish, the
reading being so difficult to him, that he told us he could only
master his intense emotion by keeping the picture of Plorn, well,
strong and hearty, steadily before his eyes.&nbsp; We can see by
the different child characters in his books what a wonderful
knowledge he had of children, and what a wonderful and truly
womanly sympathy he had with them in all their childish joys and
griefs.&nbsp; I can remember with us, his own children, how kind,
considerate and patient he always was.&nbsp; But we were never
afraid to go to him in any trouble, and never had a snub from him
or a cross word under any circumstances.&nbsp; He was always glad
to give us &ldquo;treats,&rdquo; as he called them, and used to
conceive all manner of those &ldquo;treats&rdquo; for us, and if
any favor had to be asked we were always sure of a favorable
answer.&nbsp; On these occasions my sister &ldquo;Katie&rdquo;
was generally our messenger, we others waiting <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>outside the
study door to hear the verdict.&nbsp; She and I used to have
delightful treats in those summer evenings, driving up to
Hampstead in the open carriage with him, our mother, and
&ldquo;Auntie,&rdquo; <a name="citation15"></a><a
href="#footnote15" class="citation">[15]</a> and getting out for
a long walk through the lovely country lanes, picking wild roses
and other flowers, or walking hand in hand with him listening to
some story.</p>
<p>There never existed, I think, in all the world, a more
thoroughly tidy or methodical creature than was my father.&nbsp;
He was tidy in every way&mdash;in his mind, in his handsome and
graceful person, in his work, in keeping his writing table
drawers, in his large correspondence, in fact in his whole
life.</p>
<p>I remember that my sister and I occupied <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>a little
garret room in Devonshire Terrace, at the very top of the
house.&nbsp; He had taken the greatest pains and care to make the
room as pretty and comfortable for his two little daughters as it
could be made.&nbsp; He was often dragged up the steep staircase
to this room to see some new print or some new ornament which we
children had put up, and he always gave us words of praise and
approval.&nbsp; He encouraged us in every possible way to make
ourselves useful, and to adorn and beautify our rooms with our
own hands, and to be ever tidy and neat.&nbsp; I remember that
the adornment of this garret was decidedly primitive, the
unframed prints being fastened to the wall by ordinary black or
white pins, whichever we could get.&nbsp; But, never mind, if
they were put up neatly and tidily they were always
&ldquo;excellent,&rdquo; or &ldquo;quite slap-up&rdquo; as he
used to say.&nbsp; Even in those early days, he made a point of
visiting every room in the house once each morning, and if a <!--
page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>chair was out of its place, or a blind not quite
straight, or a crumb left on the floor, woe betide the
offender.</p>
<p>And then his punctuality!&nbsp; It was almost frightful to an
unpunctual mind!&nbsp; This again was another phase of his
extreme tidiness; it was also the outcome of his excessive
thoughtfulness and consideration for others.&nbsp; His sympathy,
also, with all pain and suffering made him quite invaluable in a
sick room.&nbsp; Quick, active, sensible, bright and cheery, and
sympathetic to a degree, he would seize the &ldquo;case&rdquo; at
once, know exactly what to do and do it.&nbsp; In all our
childish ailments his visits were eagerly looked forward to; and
our little hearts would beat a shade faster, and our aches and
pains become more bearable, when the sound of his quick footstep
was heard, and the encouraging accents of his voice greeted the
invalid.&nbsp; I can remember now, as if it were yesterday, how
the touch of his hand&mdash;he had a most sympathetic <!-- page
18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>touch&mdash;was almost too much sometimes, the help and
hope in it making my heart full to overflowing.&nbsp; He believed
firmly in the power of mesmerism, as a remedy in some forms of
illness, and was himself a mesmerist of no mean order; I know of
many cases, my own among the number, in which he used his power
in this way with perfect success.</p>
<p>And however busy he might be, and even in his hours of
relaxation, he was still, if you can understand me, always busy;
he would give up any amount of time and spare himself no fatigue
if he could in any way alleviate sickness and pain.</p>
<p>In very many of my father&rsquo;s books there are frequent
references to delicious meals, wonderful dinners and more
marvellous dishes, steaming bowls of punch, etc, which have led
many to believe that he was a man very fond of the table.&nbsp;
And yet I think no more abstemious man ever lived.</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>In the &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill&rdquo; days, when the
house was full of visitors, he had a peculiar notion of always
having the menu for the day&rsquo;s dinner placed on the
sideboard at luncheon time.&nbsp; And then he would discuss every
item in his fanciful, humorous way with his guests, much to this
effect: &ldquo;Cock-a-leekie?&nbsp; Good, decidedly good; fried
soles with shrimp sauce?&nbsp; Good again; croquettes of
chicken?&nbsp; Weak, very weak; decided want of imagination
here,&rdquo; and so on, and he would apparently be so taken up
with the merits or demerits of a menu that one might imagine he
lived for nothing but the coming dinner.&nbsp; He had a small but
healthy appetite, but was remarkably abstemious both in eating
and drinking.</p>
<p>He was delightful as a host, caring individually for each
guest, and bringing the special qualities of each into full
notice and prominence, putting the very shyest at his or her
ease, making the best of the <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>most humdrum,
and never thrusting himself forward.</p>
<p>But when he was most delightful, was alone with us at home and
sitting over dessert, and when my sister was with us
especially&mdash;I am talking now of our grownup days&mdash;for
she had great power in &ldquo;drawing him out.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
such times although he might sit down to dinner in a grave or
abstracted mood, he would, invariably, soon throw aside his
silence and end by delighting us all with his genial talk and his
quaint fancies about people and things.&nbsp; He was always, as I
have said, much interested in mesmerism, and the curious
influence exercised by one personality over another.&nbsp; One
illustration I remember his using was, that meeting someone in
the busy London streets, he was on the point of turning back to
accost the supposed friend, when finding out his mistake in time
he walked on again until he actually met the real friend, whose
shadow, as it <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>were, but a moment ago had come
across his path.</p>
<p>And then the forgetting of a word or a name.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now
into what pigeon-hole of my brain did that go, and why do I
suddenly remember it now?&rdquo;&nbsp; And as these thoughts
passed through his mind and were spoken dreamily, so they also
appeared in his face.&nbsp; Another instant, perhaps, and his
eyes would be full of fun and laughter.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his literary career he suffered a great
sorrow in the death&mdash;a very sudden death&mdash;of my
mother&rsquo;s sister, Mary Hogarth.&nbsp; She was of a most
charming and lovable disposition, as well as being personally
very beautiful.&nbsp; Soon after my parents married, Aunt Mary
was constantly with them.&nbsp; As her nature developed she
became my father&rsquo;s ideal of what a young girl should
be.&nbsp; And his own words show how this great affection and the
influence of the girl&rsquo;s loved memory were with him to the
end of his life.&nbsp; The <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>shock of her
sudden death so affected and prostrated him that the publication
of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; was interrupted for two months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look back,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;and with unmingled
pleasure, to every link which each ensuing week has added to the
chain of our attachment.&nbsp; It shall go hard I hope ere
anything but death impairs the toughness of a bond now so firmly
riveted.&nbsp; That beautiful passage you were so kind and
considerate as to send to me has given me the only feeling akin
to pleasure, sorrowful pleasure it is, that I have yet had
connected with the loss of my dear young friend and companion,
for whom my love and attachment will never diminish, and by whose
side, if it please God to leave me in possession of sense to
signify my wishes, my bones whenever or wherever I die, will one
day be laid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>and her grave
bears the following inscription, written by my father:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young, beautiful, and good, God in His mercy numbered
her among His angels at the early age of seventeen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A year after her death, in writing to my mother from
Yorkshire, he says: &ldquo;Is it not extraordinary that the same
dreams which have constantly visited me since poor Mary died
follow me everywhere?&nbsp; After all the change of scene and
fatigue I have dreamt of her ever since I left home, and no doubt
shall until I return.&nbsp; I would fain believe, sometimes, that
her spirit may have some influence over them, but their perpetual
repetition is extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the course of years there came changes in our home,
inevitable changes.&nbsp; But no changes could ever alter my
father&rsquo;s home-loving nature.&nbsp; As he wrote to Mr.
Forster, as a young man, so it was with him to the time of his
death: &ldquo;We <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span

happier than ever we were in all our lives.&nbsp; Oh!
home&mdash;home&mdash;home!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Christmas was always a time which in our home was looked
forward to with eagerness and delight, and to my father it was a
time dearer than any other part of the year, I think.&nbsp; He
loved Christmas for its deep significance as well as for its
joys, and this he demonstrates in every allusion in his writings
to the great festival, a day which he considered should be
fragrant with the love that we should bear one to another, and
with the love and reverence of his Saviour and Master.&nbsp; Even
in his most merry conceits of Christmas, there are always subtle
and tender touches which will bring tears to the eyes, and make
even the thoughtless have some special <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>veneration
for this most blessed anniversary.</p>
<p>In our childish days my father used to take us, every
twenty-fourth day of December, to a toy shop in Holborn, where we
were allowed to select our Christmas presents, and also any that
we wished to give to our little companions.&nbsp; Although I
believe we were often an hour or more in the shop before our
several tastes were satisfied, he never showed the least
impatience, was always interested, and as desirous as we, that we
should choose exactly what we liked best.&nbsp; As we grew older,
present giving was confined to our several birthdays, and this
annual visit to the Holborn toy shop ceased.</p>
<p>When we were only babies my father determined that we should
be taught to dance, so as early as the Genoa days we were given
our first lessons.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our oldest boy and his sisters
are to be waited upon next week by a professor of the noble art
of dancing,&rdquo; he wrote to a friend at this <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>time.&nbsp;
And again, in writing to my mother, he says: &ldquo;I hope the
dancing lessons will be a success.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t fail to let
me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our progress in the graceful art delighted him, and his
admiration of our success was evident when we exhibited to him,
as we were perfected in them, all the steps, exercises and dances
which formed our lessons.&nbsp; He always encouraged us in our
dancing, and praised our grace and aptness, although criticized
quite severely in some places for allowing his children to expend
so much time and energy upon the training of their feet.</p>
<p>When &ldquo;the boys&rdquo; came home for the holidays there
were constant rehearsals for the Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s
parties; and more especially for the dance on Twelfth Night, the
anniversary of my brother Charlie&rsquo;s birthday.&nbsp; Just
before one of these celebrations my father insisted that my
sister Katie and I should teach the polka step to Mr. Leech and
himself.&nbsp; My <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>father was as much in earnest about
learning to take that wonderful step correctly, as though there
were nothing of greater importance in the world.&nbsp; Often he
would practice gravely in a corner, without either partner or
music, and I remember one cold winter&rsquo;s night his awakening
with the fear that he had forgotten the step so strong upon him
that, jumping out of bed, by the scant illumination of the
old-fashioned rushlight, and to his own whistling, he diligently
rehearsed its &ldquo;one, two, three, one, two, three&rdquo;
until he was once more secure in his knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p28b.jpg">
<img alt="Mr. John Leech" src="images/p28s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>No one can imagine our excitement and nervousness when the
evening came on which we were to dance with our pupils.&nbsp;
Katie, who was a very little girl was to have Mr. Leech, who was
over six feet tall, for her partner, while my father was to be
mine.&nbsp; My heart beat so fast that I could scarcely breathe,
I was so fearful for the success of our exhibition.&nbsp; <!--
page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>But my fears were groundless, and we were greeted at the
finish of our dance with hearty applause, which was more than
compensation for the work which had been expended upon its
learning.</p>
<p>My father was certainly not what in the ordinary acceptation
of the term would be called &ldquo;a good dancer.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
doubt whether he had ever received any instruction in &ldquo;the
noble art&rdquo; other than that which my sister and I gave
him.&nbsp; In later years I remember trying to teach him the
Schottische, a dance which he particularly admired and desired to
learn.&nbsp; But although he was so fond of dancing, except at
family gatherings in his own or his most intimate friends&rsquo;
homes, I never remember seeing him join in it himself, and I
doubt if, even as a young man, he ever went to balls.&nbsp;
Graceful in motion, his dancing, such as it was, was natural to
him.&nbsp; Dance music was delightful to his cheery, genial
spirit; the time and steps of a dance suited his tidy <!-- page
30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>nature, if I may so speak.&nbsp; The action and the
exercise seemed to be a part of his abundant vitality.</p>
<p>While I am writing of my father&rsquo;s fondness for dancing,
a characteristic anecdote of him occurs to me.&nbsp; While he was
courting my mother, he went one summer evening to call upon
her.&nbsp; The Hogarths were living a little way out of London,
in a residence which had a drawing-room opening with French
windows on to a lawn.&nbsp; In this room my mother and her family
were seated quietly after dinner on this particular evening, when
suddenly a young sailor jumped through one of the open windows
into the apartment, whistled and danced a hornpipe, and before
they could recover from their amazement jumped out again.&nbsp; A
few minutes later my father walked in at the door as sedately as
though quite innocent of the prank, and shook hands with
everyone; but the sight of their amazed faces proving too much
for <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>his attempted sobriety, his hearty laugh was the signal
for the rest of the party to join in his merriment.&nbsp; But
judging from his slight ability in later years, I fancy that he
must have taken many lessons to secure his perfection in that
hornpipe.</p>
<p>His dancing was at its best, I think, in the &ldquo;Sir Roger
de Coverly&rdquo;&mdash;and in what are known as country
dances.&nbsp; In the former, while the end couples are dancing,
and the side couples are supposed to be still, my father would
insist upon the sides keeping up a kind of jig step, and clapping
his hands to add to the fun, and dancing at the backs of those
whose enthusiasm he thought needed rousing, was himself never
still for a moment until the dance was over.&nbsp; He was very
fond of a country dance which he learned at the house of some
dear friends at Rockingham Castle, which began with quite a
stately minuet to the tune of &ldquo;God save the Queen,&rdquo;
and then dashed suddenly <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>into
&ldquo;Down the Middle and up Again.&rdquo;&nbsp; His enthusiasm
in this dance, I remember, was so great that, one evening after
some of our Tavistock House theatricals, when I was thoroughly
worn out with fatigue, being selected by him as his partner, I
caught the infection of his merriment, and my weariness
vanished.&nbsp; As he himself says, in describing dear old
&ldquo;Fezziwig&rsquo;s&rdquo; Christmas party, we were
&ldquo;people who would dance and had no notion of
walking.&rdquo;&nbsp; His enjoyment of all our frolics was
equally keen, and he writes to an American friend, <i>&agrave;
propos</i> of one of our Christmas merry-makings: &ldquo;Forster
is out again; and if he don&rsquo;t go in again after the manner
in which we have been keeping Christmas, he must be very strong
indeed.&nbsp; Such dinings, such conjurings, such
blindman&rsquo;s buffings, such theatre goings, such kissings out
of old years and kissings in of new ones never took place in
these parts before.&nbsp; To keep the Chuzzlewit going, and to do
this little <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>book the Carol, in the odd times
between two parts of it, was, as you may suppose, pretty tight
work.&nbsp; But when it was done I broke out like a madman, and
if you could have seen me at a children&rsquo;s party at
Macready&rsquo;s the other night going down a country dance with
Mrs. M. you would have thought I was a country gentleman of
independent property residing on a tip-top farm, with the wind
blowing straight in my face every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At our holiday frolics he used sometimes to conjure for us,
the equally &ldquo;noble art&rdquo; of the prestidigitateur being
among his accomplishments.&nbsp; He writes of this, which he
included in the list of our Twelfth Night amusements, to another
American friend: &ldquo;The actuary of the national debt
couldn&rsquo;t calculate the number of children who are coming
here on Twelfth Night, in honor of Charlie&rsquo;s birthday, for
which occasion I have provided a magic lantern and divers other
tremendous engines of that nature.&nbsp; <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>But the best
of it is that Forster and I have purchased between us the entire
stock-in-trade of a conjuror, the practice and display whereof is
entrusted to me.&nbsp; And if you could see me conjuring the
company&rsquo;s watches into impossible tea-caddies and causing
pieces of money to fly, and burning pocket handkerchiefs without
burning &rsquo;em, and practising in my own room without anybody
to admire, you would never forget it as long as you
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of these conjuring tricks comprised the disappearance and
reappearance of a tiny doll, which would announce most unexpected
pieces of news and messages to the different children in the
audience; this doll was a particular favorite, and its arrival
eagerly awaited and welcomed.</p>
<p>That he loved to emphasize Christmas in every possible way,
the following extract from a note which he sent me in December,
1868, will evidence.&nbsp; After speaking of a reading which he
was to give on Christmas <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Eve, he says:
&ldquo;It occurs to me that my table at St. James&rsquo; Hall
might be appropriately ornamented with a little holly next
Tuesday.&nbsp; If the two front legs were entwined with it, for
instance, and a border of it ran round the top of the fringe in
front, with a little sprig by way of bouquet at each corner, it
would present a seasonable appearance.&nbsp; If you think of this
and will have the materials ready in a little basket, I will call
for you at the office and take you up to the hall where the table
will be ready for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I think that our Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s tides at
&ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill&rdquo; were the happiest of all.&nbsp;
Our house was always filled with guests, while a cottage in the
village was reserved for the use of the bachelor members of our
holiday party.&nbsp; My father himself, always deserted work for
the week, and that was almost our greatest treat.&nbsp; He was
the fun and life of those gatherings, the true Christmas spirit
of <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>sweetness and hospitality filling his large and generous
heart.&nbsp; Long walks with him were daily treats to be
remembered.&nbsp; Games passed our evenings merrily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Proverbs,&rdquo; a game of memory, was very popular, and
it was one in which either my aunt or myself was apt to prove
winner.&nbsp; Father&rsquo;s annoyance at our failure sometimes
was very amusing, but quite genuine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dumb
Crambo&rdquo; was another favorite, and one in which my
father&rsquo;s great imitative ability showed finely.&nbsp; I
remember one evening his dumb showing of the word
&ldquo;frog&rdquo; was so extremely laughable that the memory of
it convulsed Marcus Stone, the clever artist, when he tried some
time later to imitate it.</p>
<p>One very severe Christmas, when the snow was so deep as to
make outdoor amusement or entertainment for our guests
impossible, my father suggested that he and the inhabitants of
the &ldquo;bachelors&rsquo; cottage&rdquo; should pass the time
in unpacking <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>the French chalet, which had been
sent to him by Mr. Fetcher, and which reached Higham Station in a
large number of packing cases.&nbsp; Unpacking these and fitting
the pieces together gave them interesting employment, and some
topics of conversation for our luncheon party.</p>
<p>Our Christmas Day dinners at &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill&rdquo;
were particularly bright and cheery, some of our nearest
neighbours joining our home party.&nbsp; The Christmas plum
pudding had its own special dish of coloured
&ldquo;repouss&eacute;&rdquo; china, ornamented with holly.&nbsp;
The pudding was placed on this with a sprig of real holly in the
centre, lighted, and in this state placed in front of my father,
its arrival being always the signal for applause.&nbsp; A
prettily decorated table was his special pleasure, and from my
earliest girlhood the care of this devolved upon me.&nbsp; When I
had everything in readiness, he would come with me to inspect the
result of my labors, before dressing <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>for dinner,
and no word except of praise ever came to my ears.</p>
<p>He was a wonderfully neat and rapid carver, and I am happy to
say taught me some of his skill in this.&nbsp; I used to help him
in our home parties at &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill&rdquo; by carving
at a side table, returning to my seat opposite him as soon as my
duty was ended.&nbsp; On Christmas Day we all had our glasses
filled, and then my father, raising his, would say:
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to us all.&nbsp; God bless us!&rdquo; a toast
which was rapidly and willingly drunk.&nbsp; His conversation, as
may be imagined, was often extremely humorous, and I have seen
the servants, who were waiting at table, convulsed often with
laughter at his droll remarks and stories.&nbsp; Now, as I recall
these gatherings, my sight grows blurred with the tears that rise
to my eyes.&nbsp; But I love to remember them, and to see, if
only in memory, my father at his own table, surrounded by <!--
page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>his own family and friends&mdash;a beautiful Christmas
spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good to be children sometimes, and never better
than at Christmas, when its Mighty Founder was a child
himself,&rdquo; was his own advice, and advice which he followed
both in letter and spirit.</p>
<p>One morning&mdash;it was the last day of the year, I
remember&mdash;while we were at breakfast at &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s
Hill,&rdquo; my father suggested that we should celebrate the
evening by a charade to be acted in pantomime.&nbsp; The
suggestion was received with acclamation, and amid shouts and
laughing we were then and there, guests and members of the
family, allotted our respective parts.&nbsp; My father went about
collecting &ldquo;stage properties,&rdquo; rehearsals were
&ldquo;called&rdquo; at least four times during the morning, and
in all our excitement no thought was given to that necessary part
of a charade, the audience, whose business it is to guess the
pantomime.&nbsp; At luncheon someone asked <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>suddenly:
&ldquo;But what about an audience?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, bless
my soul,&rdquo; said my father, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten all
about that.&rdquo;&nbsp; Invitations were quickly dispatched to
our neighbours, and additional preparations made for
supper.&nbsp; In due time the audience came, and the charade was
acted so successfully that the evening stands out in my memory as
one of the merriest and happiest of the many merry and happy
evenings in our dear old home.&nbsp; My father was so extremely
funny in his part that the rest of us found it almost impossible
to maintain sufficient control over ourselves to enable the
charade to proceed as it was planned to do.&nbsp; It wound up
with a country dance, which had been invented that morning and
practised quite a dozen times through the day, and which was
concluded at just a few moments before midnight.&nbsp; Then
leading us all, characters and audience, out into the wide hall,
and throwing wide open the door, my father, watch in hand, stood
<!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>waiting to hear the bells ring in the New Year.&nbsp;
All was hush and silence after the laughter and merriment!&nbsp;
Suddenly the peal of bells sounded, and turning he said: &ldquo;A
happy New Year to us all!&nbsp; God bless us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Kisses, good wishes and shaking of hands brought us again back to
the fun and gaiety of a few moments earlier.&nbsp; Supper was
served, the hot mulled wine drunk in toasts, and the maddest and
wildest of &ldquo;Sir Roger de Coverlys&rdquo; ended our evening
and began our New Year.</p>
<p>One New year&rsquo;s day my father organized some field sports
in a meadow which was at the back of our house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Foot
races for the villagers come off in my field to-morrow,&rdquo; he
wrote to a friend, &ldquo;and we have been hard at work all day,
building a course, making countless flags, and I don&rsquo;t know
what else, Layard (the late Sir Henry Layard) is chief
commissioner of the domestic police.&nbsp; The country police
predict an immense crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>There were between two and three thousand people present
at these sports, and by a kind of magical influence, my father
seemed to rule every creature present to do his or her best to
maintain order.&nbsp; The likelihood of things going wrong was
anticipated, and despite the general prejudice of the neighbours
against the undertaking, my father&rsquo;s belief and trust in
his guests was not disappointed.&nbsp; But you shall have his own
account of his success.&nbsp; &ldquo;We had made a very pretty
course,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;and taken great pains.&nbsp;
Encouraged by the cricket matches&rsquo; experience, I allowed
the landlord of the Falstaff to have a drinking booth on the
ground.&nbsp; Not to seem to dictate or distrust, I gave all the
prizes in money.&nbsp; The great mass of the crowd were laboring
men of all kinds, soldiers, sailors and navvies.&nbsp; They did
not, between half-past ten, when we began, and sunset, displace a
rope or a stake; and they left every barrier and flag as neat as
they found it.&nbsp; <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>There was not a dispute, and there
was no drunkenness whatever.&nbsp; I made them a little speech
from the lawn at the end of the games, saying that, please God,
we would do it again next year.&nbsp; They cheered most lustily
and dispersed.&nbsp; The road between this and Chatham was like a
fair all day; and surely it is a fine thing to get such perfect
behaviour out of a reckless seaport town.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was the
last to realize, I am sure that it was his own sympathetic nature
which gave him the love and honor of all classes, and that helped
to make the day&rsquo;s sports such a great success!</p>
<p>My father was again in his element at the Twelfth Night
parties to which I have before alluded.&nbsp; For many
consecutive years, Miss Coutts, now the Baroness Burdett Coutts,
was in the habit of sending my brother, on this his birthday
anniversary, the most gorgeous of Twelfth-cakes, with an
accompanying box of bonbons and Twelfth Night characters.&nbsp;
The <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>cake was cut, and the favors and bonbons distributed at
the birthday supper, and it was then that my father&rsquo;s
kindly, genial nature overflowed in merriment.&nbsp; He would
have something droll to say to everyone, and under his attentions
the shyest child would brighten and become merry.&nbsp; No one
was overlooked or forgotten by him; like the young Cratchits, he
was &ldquo;ubiquitous.&rdquo;&nbsp; Supper was followed by songs
and recitations from the various members of the company, my
father acting always as master of ceremonies, and calling upon
first one child, then another for his or her contribution to the
festivity.&nbsp; I can see now the anxious faces turned toward
the beaming, laughing eyes of their host.&nbsp; How attentively
he would listen, with his head thrown slightly back, and a little
to one side, a happy smile on his lips.&nbsp; O, those merry,
happy times, never to be forgotten by any of his own children, or
by any of their guests.&nbsp; Those merry, happy times!</p>
<p><!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>And in writing thus of these dear old holidays, when we
were all so happy in our home, and when my father was with us,
let me add this little postscript, and greet you on this
Christmas of 1896, with my father&rsquo;s own words:
&ldquo;Reflect upon your present blessings&mdash;of which every
man has many&mdash;not on your past misfortunes, of which all men
have some.&nbsp; Fill your glass again with a merry face and
contented heart.&nbsp; Our life on it, but your Christmas shall
be merry and your New Year a happy one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So may the New Year be a happy one to you, happy to
many more whose happiness depends on you!&nbsp; So may each year
be happier than the last, and not the meanest of our brethren or
sisterhood debarred their rightful share in what our great
Creator formed them to enjoy.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>When at work my father was almost always alone, so that, with
rare exceptions, save as we could see the effect of the
adventures of his characters upon him in his daily moods, we knew
but little of his manner of work.&nbsp; Absolute quiet under
these circumstances was essential, the slightest sound making an
interruption fatal to the success of his labors, although, oddly
enough, in his leisure hours the bustle and noise of a great city
seemed necessary to him.&nbsp; He writes, after an enforced
idleness of two years, spent in a quiet place; &ldquo;The
difficulty of going at what I call a rapid pace is <!-- page
47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>prodigious; indeed, it is almost an impossibility.&nbsp;
I suppose this is partly the effect of two years&rsquo; ease, and
partly the absence of streets, and numbers of figures.&nbsp; I
cannot express how much I want these.&nbsp; It seems as if they
supplied something to my brain which, when busy, it cannot bear
to lose.&nbsp; For a week or fortnight I can write prodigiously
in a retired place, a day in London setting and starting me up
again.&nbsp; But the toil and labor of writing day after day
without that magic lantern is immense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I have said, he was usually alone when at work, though
there were, of course, some occasional exceptions, and I myself
constituted such an exception.&nbsp; During our life at Tavistock
House, I had a long and serious illness, with an almost equally
long convalescence.&nbsp; During the latter, my father suggested
that I should be carried every day into his study to remain with
him, and, although I was fearful of disturbing him, he assured me
that he desired to have me <!-- page 48--><a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>with
him.&nbsp; On one of these mornings, I was lying on the sofa
endeavouring to keep perfectly quiet, while my father wrote
busily and rapidly at his desk, when he suddenly jumped from his
chair and rushed to a mirror which hung near, and in which I
could see the reflection of some extraordinary facial contortions
which he was making.&nbsp; He returned rapidly to his desk, wrote
furiously for a few moments, and then went again to the
mirror.&nbsp; The facial pantomime was resumed, and then turning
toward, but evidently not seeing, me, he began talking rapidly in
a low voice.&nbsp; Ceasing this soon, however, he returned once
more to his desk, where he remained silently writing until
luncheon time.&nbsp; It was a most curious experience for me, and
one of which, I did not until later years, fully appreciate the
purport.&nbsp; Then I knew that with his natural intensity he had
thrown himself completely into the character that he was
creating, and that for the time being he had not only lost <!--
page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>sight of his surroundings, but had actually become in
action, as in imagination, the creature of his pen.</p>
<p>His &ldquo;studies&rdquo; were always cheery, pleasant rooms,
and always, like himself, the personification of neatness and
tidiness.&nbsp; On the shelf of his writing table were many
dainty and useful ornaments, gifts from his friends or members of
his family, and always, a vase of bright and fresh flowers.&nbsp;
The first study that I remember is the one in our Devonshire
Terrace home, a pretty room, with steps leading directly into the
garden from it, and with an extra baize door to keep out all
sounds and noise.&nbsp; The study at Tavistock House was more
elaborate; a fine large room, opening into the drawing-room by
means of sliding doors.&nbsp; When the rooms were thrown together
they gave my father a promenade of considerable length for the
constant indoor walking which formed a favorite recreation for
him after a hard day&rsquo;s writing.</p>
<p><!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>At &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill&rdquo; he first made a study
from one of the large spare sleeping rooms of the house, as the
windows there overlooked a beautiful and favorite view of
his.&nbsp; His writing table was always placed near a window
looking out into the open world which he loved so keenly.&nbsp;
Afterwards he occupied for years a smaller room overlooking the
back garden and a pretty meadow, but this he eventually turned
into a miniature billiard room, and then established himself,
finally, in the room on the right side of the entrance hall
facing the front garden.&nbsp; It is this room which Mr. Luke
Fildes, the great artist and our own esteemed friend, made famous
in his picture &ldquo;The Empty Chair,&rdquo; which he sketched
for &ldquo;The Graphic&rdquo; after my father&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; The writing table, the ornaments, the huge waste
paper basket, which &ldquo;the master&rdquo; had made for his own
use, are all there, and, alas, the empty chair!</p>
<p>That he was always in earnest, that he <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>lived with
his creations, that their joys and sorrows were his joys and
sorrows, that at times his anguish, both of body and spirit, was
poignant and heart-breaking, I know.&nbsp; His interest in and
love for his characters were intense as his nature, and is shown
nowhere more strongly than in his sufferings during his portrayal
of the short life of &ldquo;Little Nell,&rdquo; like a father he
mourned for his little girl&mdash;the child of his
brain&mdash;and he writes: &ldquo;I am, for the time, nearly dead
with work and grief for the loss of my child.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again
he writes of her: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t imagine (gravely I write
and speak) how exhausted I am to-day with yesterday&rsquo;s
labors.&nbsp; I went to bed last night utterly dispirited and
done up.&nbsp; All night I have been pursued by the child; and
this morning I am unrefreshed and miserable.&nbsp; I do not know
what to do with myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His love and care for this little one are <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>shown most
pathetically in the suggestions which he gave to Mr. George
Cattermole for his illustrations of the &ldquo;Old Curiosity
Shop.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Kit, the single gentleman, and Mr.
Garland go down to the place where the child is and arrive there
at night.&nbsp; There has been a fall of snow.&nbsp; Kit, leaving
them behind, runs to the old house, and with a lantern in one
hand, and the bird in its cage in the other, stops for a moment
at a little distance, with a natural hesitation, before he goes
up to make his presence known.&nbsp; In a window&mdash;supposed
to be that of the child&rsquo;s little room&mdash;a light is
burning, and in that room the child (unknown, of course, to her
visitors, who are full of hope), lies dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again: &ldquo;The child lying dead in the little sleeping
room, behind the open screen.&nbsp; It is winter time, so there
are no flowers, but upon her breast and pillow there may be
strips of holly and berries and such green things.&nbsp; A
window, overgrown with ivy.&nbsp; The little boy who had that
talk with her <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>about the angels may be by the
bedside, if you like it so; but I think it will be quieter and
more peaceful if she is quite alone.&nbsp; I want the scene to
express the most beautiful repose and tranquillity, and to have
something of a happy look, if death can do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another: &ldquo;The child has been buried within the church,
and the old man, who cannot be made to understand that she is
dead repairs to the grave and sits there all day long, waiting
for her arrival to begin another journey.&nbsp; His staff and
knapsack, her little bonnet and basket, lie beside him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She&rsquo;ll come to-morrow,&rsquo; he says, when it gets
dark, and then goes sorrowfully home.&nbsp; I think an hour glass
running out would keep up the notion; perhaps her little things
upon his knee or in his hand.&nbsp; I am breaking my heart over
this story, and cannot bear to finish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In acknowledging the receipt of a letter concerning this book
from Mr. John Tomlin, an American, he wrote: &ldquo;I thank you
<!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>cordially and heartily for your letter, and for its kind
and courteous terms.&nbsp; To think that I have awakened among
the vast solitudes in which you dwell a fellow feeling and
sympathy with the creatures of many thoughtful hours, is the
source of the purest delight and pride to me; and believe me that
your expressions of affectionate remembrance and approval,
sounding from the green forests of the Mississippi, sink deeper
into my heart and gratify it more than all the honorary
distinctions that all the courts of Europe could confer.&nbsp; It
is such things as these that make one hope one does not live in
vain, and that are the highest rewards of an author&rsquo;s
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His genius for character sketching needs no proof&mdash;his
characters live to vouch for themselves, for their reality.&nbsp;
It is ever amazing to me that the hand which drew the pathetic
and beautiful creations, the kindly humored men, the lovely
women, the unfortunate little ones, could portray also <!-- page
55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>with
such marvellous accuracy the villainy and craftiness of such
characters as Bumble, Bill Sykes, Pecksniff, Uriah Heep and
Squeers.&nbsp; Undoubtedly from his earliest childhood he had
possessed the quick perception, the instinct, which could read in
people&rsquo;s characters their tendencies toward good and evil,
and throughout his life he valued this ability above literary
skill and finish.&nbsp; Mr. Forster makes a point of this in his
biography, speaking of the noticeable traits in him: &ldquo;What
I had most, indeed, to notice in him at the very outset of his
career, was his indifference to any praise of his performances on
their merely literary merit, compared with the higher recognition
of them as bits of actual life, with the meaning and purpose on
their part, and the responsibility on his, of realities rather
than creatures of fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he was always pleased with praise, and always modest and
grateful in returning it.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can I thank
you?&rdquo; he writes to <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>a friend who
was expressing his pleasure at &ldquo;Oliver Twist.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can I do better than by saying that the sense of poor
Oliver&rsquo;s reality, which I know you have had from the first,
has been the highest of all praise to me?&nbsp; None that has
been lavished upon me have I felt half so much as that
appreciation of my intent and meaning.&nbsp; Your notices make me
very grateful, but very proud, so have a care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The impressions which were later converted into motives and
plots for his stories he imbibed often in his earliest
childhood.&nbsp; The crusade against the Yorkshire schools which
is waged in &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo; is the working out
of some of these childish impressions.&nbsp; He writes himself of
them: &ldquo;I cannot call to mind how I came to hear about
Yorkshire schools, when I was not a very robust child, sitting in
by-places near Rochester Castle with a head full of Partridge,
Strap, Tom Pipes and Sancho Panza, but I know my first
impressions of <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>the schools were picked up at this
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; We can imagine how deeply the wrongs must have
sunk into the sensitive heart of the child, rankling there
through many years, to bear fruit in the scourging of them and
their abuses from the land.&nbsp; While he was at work upon
&ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo; he sent one of his
characteristic letters in reply to a little boy&mdash;Master
Hasting Hughes&mdash;who wrote to ask him to make some changes in
the story.&nbsp; As some of you may not have read this letter,
and as it is so extremely amusing, I shall quote part of it:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Doughty Street</span>, <span
class="smcap">London</span>.<br />
&ldquo;December 12th, 1838.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Respected Sir: I have given Squeers one cut on the
neck, and two on the head, at which he appeared much surprised,
and began to cry, which, being a cowardly thing, is just what I
should have expected from him&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have carefully done what you told me in your letter
about the lamb and the two <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>&lsquo;sheeps&rsquo; for the little boys.&nbsp; They
have also had some good ale and porter and some wine.&nbsp; I am
sorry you did not say what wine you would like them to
have.&nbsp; I gave them some sherry, which they liked very much,
except one boy who was a little sick and choked a good
deal.&nbsp; He was rather greedy, and that&rsquo;s the truth, and
I believe it went the wrong way, which I say served him right,
and I hope you will say so too.&nbsp; Nick has had his roast
lamb, as you said he was to, but he could not eat it all, and
says if you do not mind his doing so he should like to have the
rest hashed to-morrow with some greens, which he is very fond of,
and so am I.&nbsp; He said he did not like to have his porter
hot, for he thought it spoilt the flavour, so I let him have it
cold.&nbsp; You should have seen him drink it.&nbsp; I thought he
never would have left off.&nbsp; I also gave him three pounds in
money, all in sixpences to make it seem more, and he said
directly that he should give more than half to his <!-- page
59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>mamma
and sister, and divide the rest with poor Smike.&nbsp; And I say
he is a good fellow for saying so; and if anybody says he
isn&rsquo;t, I am ready to fight him whenever they
like&mdash;there!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fanny Squeers shall be attended to, depend upon
it.&nbsp; Your drawing of her is very like, except that I do not
think the hair is quite curly enough.&nbsp; The nose is
particularly like hers, and so are the legs.&nbsp; She is a
nasty, disagreeable thing, and I know it will make her very cross
when she sees it, and what I say is that I hope it may.&nbsp; You
will say the same, I know&mdash;at least I think you
will.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The amount of work which he could accomplish varied greatly at
certain times, though in its entirety it was so immense.&nbsp;
When he became the man of letters, and ceased the irregular,
unmethodical life of the reporter, his mornings were invariably
spent at his desk.&nbsp; The time between breakfast and luncheon,
with an occasional <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>extension of a couple of hours into
the afternoon, were given over to his creations.&nbsp; The
exceptions were when he was taking a holiday or resting, though
even when ostensibly employed in the latter, cessation from story
writing meant the answering of letters and the closer attention
to his business matters, so that but little of real rest ever
came into his later life.</p>
<p>While in Italy he gave a fragmentary diary of his daily life
in a letter to a friend, and the routine was there very much what
it was at home.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am in a regular ferocious
excitement with the Chimes; get up at seven; have a cold bath
before breakfast; and blaze away, wrathful and red-hot, until
three o&rsquo;clock or so, when I usually knock off (unless it
rains) for the day.&nbsp; I am fierce to finish in a spirit
bearing some affinity to that of truth and mercy, and to shame
the cruel and the wicked, but it is hard work.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
entire discomfort under sound interruptions is also shown in the
<!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>above, in his reference to the Chimes, and the effect
which they had upon him.</p>
<p>Despite his regularity of working hours, as I have said, the
amount of work which my father accomplished varied greatly.&nbsp;
His manuscripts were usually written upon white
&ldquo;slips,&rdquo; though sometimes upon blue paper, and there
were many mornings when it would be impossible for him to fill
one of these.&nbsp; He writes on one occasion: &ldquo;I am
sitting at home, patiently waiting for Oliver Twist, who has not
yet arrived.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, indeed, &ldquo;Oliver&rdquo; gave
him considerable trouble, in the course of his adventures, by his
disinclination to be put upon paper easily.&nbsp; This slowness
in writing marked more prominently the earlier period of my
father&rsquo;s literary career, though these &ldquo;blank
days,&rdquo; when his brain refused to work, were of occasional
occurrence to the end.&nbsp; He was very critical of his own
labors, and would bring nothing but the best of his brain to the
art which he so dearly loved&mdash;<!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>his venerated
mistress.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, the amount of work which
he would accomplish at other times was almost incredible.&nbsp;
During a long sojourn at Lausanne he writes: &ldquo;I have not
been idle since I have been here.&nbsp; I had a good deal to
write for Lord John about the ragged schools; so I set to work
and did that.&nbsp; A good deal to Miss Coutts, in reference to
her charitable projects; so I set to work and did that.&nbsp;
Half of the children&rsquo;s New Testament to write, or pretty
nearly.&nbsp; I set to work and did that.&nbsp; Next, I cleared
off the greater part of such correspondence as I had rashly
pledged myself to, and then&mdash;began Dombey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know of only one occasion on which he employed an
amanuensis, and my aunt is my authority for the following,
concerning this one time: &ldquo;The book which your father
dictated to me was &lsquo;The Child&rsquo;s History of
England.&rsquo;&nbsp; The reason for my being used in this
capacity of secretary was that <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>&lsquo;Bleak
House&rsquo; was being written at the same time, and your father
would dictate to me while walking about the room, as a relief
after his long, sedentary imprisonment.&nbsp; The history was
being written for &lsquo;Household Words,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bleak
House&rsquo; also as a serial, so he had both weekly and monthly
work on hand at the same time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The history was
dedicated: &ldquo;To my own dear children, whom I hope it will
help, by-and-by, to read with interest larger and better books
upon the same subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My father wrote always with a quill pen and blue ink, and
never, I think, used a lead pencil.&nbsp; His handwriting was
considered extremely difficult to read by many people, but I
never found it so.&nbsp; In his manuscripts there were so many
erasures, and such frequent interlineations that a special staff
of compositors was used for his work, but this was not on account
of any illegibility in his handwriting.&nbsp; The manuscripts are
most of them, exhibited at <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>the South
Kensington Museum in &ldquo;the Forster Collection,&rdquo; and
they all show I think, the extreme care and fastidiousness of the
writer, and his ever-constant desire to improve upon and simplify
his original sentence.&nbsp; His objection to the use of a lead
pencil was so great that even his personal memoranda, such as his
lists of guests for dinner parties, the arrangement of tables and
menus, were always written in ink.&nbsp; For his personal
correspondence he used blue note paper, and signed his name in
the left-hand corner of the envelope.&nbsp; After a
morning&rsquo;s close work he was sometimes quite pre-occupied
when he came into luncheon.&nbsp; Often, when we were only our
home party at &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill,&rdquo; he would come in,
take something to eat in a mechanical way&mdash;he never ate but
a small luncheon&mdash;and would return to his study to finish
the work he had left, scarcely having spoken a word in all this
time.&nbsp; Again, he would come in, having finished his work,
<!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>but looking very tired and worn.&nbsp; Our talking at
these times did not seem to disturb him, though any sudden sound,
as the dropping of a spoon, or the clinking of a glass, would
send a spasm of pain across his face.</p>
<p>The sudden, almost instantaneous, popularity of
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; was known to the world long before it was
realized by its anxious young author.&nbsp; All the business
transactions concerning its publication were modest to a degree,
and the preparations for such a success as came to it were
none.&nbsp; As to its popularity, Mr. Forster writes:
&ldquo;Judges on the bench, and boys in the streets, gravity and
folly, the young and the old, those who were entering life, and
those who were quitting it, alike found it
irresistible.&rdquo;&nbsp; Carlyle wrote: &ldquo;An archdeacon
repeated to me, with his own venerable lips, the other evening, a
strange, profane story of a solemn clergyman who had been
summoned to administer consolation <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>to a very ill
man.&nbsp; As he left the room he heard the sick man ejaculate:
&ldquo;Well thank God, Pickwick will be out in ten days,
anyway!&rdquo;&nbsp; No young author ever sprang into more sudden
and brilliant fame than &ldquo;Boz,&rdquo; and none could have
remained more thoroughly unspoiled, or so devoid of egotism under
success.&nbsp; His own opinion of his fame, and his estimate of
its value, may be quoted here: &ldquo;To be numbered amongst the
household gods of one&rsquo;s distant countrymen, and associated
with their homes and quiet pleasures; to be told that in each
nook and corner of the world&rsquo;s great mass there lives one
well-wisher who holds communion with one in the spirit, is a
worthy fame, indeed.&nbsp; That I may be happy enough to cheer
some of your leisure hours for a long time to come, and to hold a
place in your pleasant thoughts, is the earnest wish of
&lsquo;Boz.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the Christmas Eve of 1863 my <!-- page 67--><a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>father was
greatly shocked and distressed to hear of the sudden death of Mr.
Thackeray.&nbsp; Our guests, naturally, were full of the sad
news, and there was a gloom cast over everything.&nbsp; We all
thought of the sorrow of his two daughters, who were so devoted
to him, and whom his sudden taking away would leave so
desolate.&nbsp; In &ldquo;The Cornhill Magazine&rdquo; of the
February following, my father wrote: &ldquo;I saw Mr. Thackeray
for the first time nearly twenty-eight years ago, when he
proposed to become the illustrator of my earliest book.&nbsp; I
saw him last shortly before Christmas, at the Athen&aelig;um
Club, when he told me he had been in bed three days, and that he
had it in his mind to try a new remedy, which he laughingly
described.&nbsp; He was cheerful, and looked very bright.&nbsp;
In the night of that day week he died. * * * * No one can be
surer than I of the greatness and goodness of his heart.&nbsp; In
no place should I take it upon myself <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>at this time
to discourse of his books, of his refined knowledge of character,
of his subtle acquaintance with the weakness of human nature, of
his delightful playfulness as an essayist, of his quaint and
touching ballads, of his mastery over the English language.&nbsp;
But before me lies all that he had written of his latest story,
and the pain I have felt in perusing it has not been deeper than
the conviction that he was in the healthiest region of his powers
when he worked on this last labor.&nbsp; The last words he
corrected in print were &lsquo;and my heart throbbed with an
exquisite bliss.&rsquo;&nbsp; God grant that on that Christmas
Eve, when he laid his head back on his pillow and threw up his
arms as he had been wont to do when very weary, some
consciousness of duty done, and of Christian hope throughout life
humbly cherished, may have caused his own heart so to throb when
he passed away to his rest.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As a child my father was prevented from any active
participation in the sports and amusements of his boyish
companions by his extreme delicacy and frequent illnesses, so
that until his manhood his knowledge of games was gained merely
from long hours of watching others while lying upon the
grass.&nbsp; With manhood, however, came the strength and
activity which enabled him to take part in all kinds of outdoor
exercise and sports, and it seemed that in his passionate
enjoyment and participation in those later years he was
recompensed for the weary childhood years of suffering and
inability.&nbsp; Athletic sports were a passion with him in his
manhood, as I have said.&nbsp; In 1839 he rented a <!-- page
70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>cottage at Petersham, not far from London
&ldquo;where,&rdquo; to quote from Mr. Forster, &ldquo;the
extensive garden grounds admitted of much athletic competition,
in which Dickens, for the most part, held his own against even
such accomplished athletes as Maclise and Mr. Beard.&nbsp; Bar
leaping, bowling and quoits were among the games carried on with
the greatest ardor, and in sustained energy Dickens certainly
distanced every competitor.&nbsp; Even the lighter recreations of
battledore and bagatelle were pursued with relentless
activity.&nbsp; At such amusements as the Petersham races, in
those days rather celebrated, and which he visited daily while
they lasted, he worked much harder than the running horses
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Riding was a favorite recreation at all times with my father,
and he was constantly inviting one or another of his friends to
bear him company on these excursions.&nbsp; Always fond, in his
leisure hours, of companions, he seemed to find his rides and
walks quite <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>incomplete if made alone.&nbsp; He
writes on one occasion: &ldquo;What think you of a fifteen-mile
ride out, ditto in, and a lunch on the road, with a wind-up of
six o&rsquo;clock dinner in Doughty Street?&rdquo;&nbsp; And
again: &ldquo;Not knowing whether my head was off or on, it
became so addled with work, I have gone riding over the old road,
and shall be truly delighted to meet or be overtaken by
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a young man he was extremely fond of riding,
but as I never remember seeing him on horseback I think he must
have deprived himself of this pastime soon after his
marriage.</p>
<p>But walking was, perhaps, his chiefest pleasure, and the
country lanes and city streets alike found him a close observer
of their beauties and interests.&nbsp; He was a rapid walker, his
usual pace being four miles an hour, and to keep step with him
required energy and activity similar to his own.&nbsp; In many of
his letters he speaks with most evident enjoyment of this
pastime.&nbsp; In one <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>he writes: &ldquo;What a brilliant
morning for a country walk!&nbsp; I start
precisely&mdash;precisely, mind&mdash;at half-past one.&nbsp;
Come, come, come and walk in the green lanes!&rdquo;&nbsp; Again:
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t feel disposed, do you, to muffle yourself
up and start off with me for a good, brisk walk over Hampstead
Heath?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outdoor games of the simpler kinds delighted him.&nbsp;
Battledore and shuttlecock was played constantly in the garden at
Devonshire Terrace, though I do not remember my father ever
playing it elsewhere.&nbsp; The American game of bowls pleased
him, and rounders found him more than expert.&nbsp; Croquet he
disliked, but cricket he enjoyed intensely as a spectator, always
keeping one of the scores during the matches at
&ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a firm believer in the hygiene of bathing, and cold
baths, sea baths and shower baths were among his most constant
practices.&nbsp; In those days scientific ablution was not very
generally practised, and I am <!-- page 73--><a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>sure that in
many places during his travels my father was looked upon as an
amiable maniac with a penchant for washing.</p>
<p>During his first visit to America, while he was making some
journey in a rather rough and uncomfortable canal boat, he wrote:
&ldquo;I am considered very hardy in the morning, for I run up
barenecked and plunge my head into the half-frozen water by
half-past five o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I am respected for my
activity, inasmuch as I jump from the boat to the towing path,
and walk five or six miles before breakfast, keeping up with the
horses all the time.&rdquo;&nbsp; And from Broadstairs: &ldquo;In
a bay window sits, from nine o&rsquo;clock to one, a gentleman
with rather long hair and no neckcloth, who writes and grins as
if he thought he were very funny, indeed.&nbsp; At one
o&rsquo;clock he disappears, presently emerges from a bathing
machine, and may be seen a kind of salmon-colored porpoise,
splashing about in the ocean.&nbsp; After that, he may be viewed
in another bay window on the ground floor, eating <!-- page
74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>a
good lunch; and after that, walking a dozen miles or so, or lying
on his back on the sand reading.&nbsp; Nobody bothers him, unless
they know he is disposed to be talked to; and I am told he is
very comfortable, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the hottest summer months of our year&rsquo;s residence
in Italy, we lived at a little seaport of the Mediterranean
called Albaro.&nbsp; The bathing here was of the most primitive
kind, one division of the clear, dark-blue pools among the rocks
being reserved for women, the other for men, and as we children
were as much at home in the water as any known variety of fish,
we used to look with wonder at the so-called bathing of the
Italian women.&nbsp; They would come in swarms, beautifully
dressed, and with most elaborately arranged heads of hair, but
the slightest of wettings with them was the equivalent of a
bath.&nbsp; In the open bay at Albaro the current was very
strong, and the bathing most dangerous to even an experienced
<!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>swimmer.&nbsp; I remember one morning the terrible
fright we were given by an uncle of ours; he swam out into the
bay, was caught by the current of an ebb tide and borne out of
reach of our eyes.&nbsp; A fishing boat picked him up still
alive, though greatly exhausted.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a world of
horror and anguish crowded into four or five minutes of dreadful
agitation,&rdquo; wrote my father, &ldquo;and to complete the
terror of it the entire family, including the children, were on
the rock in full view of it all, crying like mad
creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He loved animals, flowers and birds, his fondness for the
latter being shown nowhere more strongly than in his devotion to
his ravens at Devonshire Terrace.&nbsp; He writes
characteristically of the death of &ldquo;Grip,&rdquo; the first
raven: &ldquo;You will be greatly shocked and grieved to hear
that the raven is no more.&nbsp; He expired to-day at a few
minutes after twelve o&rsquo;clock, at noon.&nbsp; He had been
ailing for a few days, but we anticipated no serious result,
conjecturing that a portion of <!-- page 76--><a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>the white
paint he swallowed last summer might be lingering about his
vitals.&nbsp; Yesterday afternoon he was taken so much worse that
I sent an express for the medical gentleman, who promptly
attended and administered a powerful dose of castor oil.&nbsp;
Under the influence of this medicine he recovered so far as to be
able, at eight o&rsquo;clock, p.m., to bite Topping (the
coachman).&nbsp; His night was peaceful.&nbsp; This morning, at
daybreak, he appeared better, and partook plentifully of some
warm gruel, the flavor of which he appeared to relish.&nbsp;
Toward eleven o&rsquo;clock he was so much worse that it was
found necessary to muffle the stable knocker.&nbsp; At half-past,
or thereabouts, he was heard talking to himself about the horse
and Topping&rsquo;s family, and to add some incoherent
expressions which are supposed to have been either a foreboding
of his approaching dissolution or some wishes relative to the
disposal of his little property, consisting chiefly of half-pence
which he had buried in <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>different parts of the garden.&nbsp;
On the clock striking twelve he appeared slightly agitated, but
he soon recovered, walked twice or thrice along the coach house,
stopped to bark, staggered, and exclaimed &lsquo;Halloa, old
girl!&rsquo; (his favorite expression) and died.&nbsp; He behaved
throughout with decent fortitude, equanimity and
self-possession.&nbsp; I deeply regret that, being in ignorance
of his danger, I did not attend to receive his last
instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something remarkable about his eyes occasioned Topping
to run for the doctor at twelve.&nbsp; When they returned
together, our friend was gone.&nbsp; It was the medical gentleman
who informed me of his decease.&nbsp; He did it with caution and
delicacy, preparing me by the remark that &lsquo;a jolly queer
start had taken place.&rsquo;&nbsp; I am not wholly free from
suspicions of poison.&nbsp; A malicious butcher has been heard to
say that he would &lsquo;do&rsquo; for him.&nbsp; His plea was
that he would not be molested in taking orders down the mews by
<!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>any bird that wore a tail.&nbsp; Were they ravens who
took manna to somebody in the wilderness?&nbsp; At times I hope
they were, and at others I fear they were not, or they would
certainly have stolen it by the way.&nbsp; Kate is as well as can
be expected.&nbsp; The children seem rather glad of it.&nbsp; He
bit their ankles, but that was in play.&rdquo;&nbsp; As my father
was writing &ldquo;Barnaby Rudge&rdquo; at this time, and wished
to continue his study of raven nature, another and a larger
&ldquo;Grip&rdquo; took the place of &ldquo;our friend&rdquo; but
it was he whose talking tricks and comical ways gave my father
the idea of making a raven one of the characters in this
book.&nbsp; My father&rsquo;s fondness for &ldquo;Grip&rdquo;
was, however, never transferred to any other raven, and none of
us ever forgave the butcher whom we all held in some way
responsible for his untimely taking off.</p>
<p>But I think his strongest love, among animals, was for
dogs.&nbsp; I find a delightful anecdote told by him of a dog
belonging to a <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span

&ldquo;Of,&rdquo; an immense, black, good-humored, Newfoundland
dog.&nbsp; He came from Oxford and had lived all his life in a
brewery.&nbsp; Instructions were given with him that if he were
let out every morning alone he would immediately find out the
river, regularly take a swim and come gravely home again.&nbsp;
This he did with the greatest punctuality, but after a little
while was observed to smell of beer.&nbsp; His owner was so sure
that he smelled of beer that she resolved to watch him.&nbsp; He
was seen to come back from his swim round the usual corner and to
go up a flight of steps into a beer shop.&nbsp; Being instantly
followed, the beer shopkeeper is seen to take down a pot (pewter
pot) and is heard to say: &ldquo;Well, old chap, come for your
beer as usual, have you?&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon which he draws a pint
and puts it down and the dog drinks it.&nbsp; Being required to
explain how this comes to pass the man says: &ldquo;Yes,
ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I know he&rsquo;s your dog, ma&rsquo;am, but I
didn&rsquo;t when he first <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>came.&nbsp;
He looked in, ma&rsquo;am, as a brick-maker might, and then he
come in, as a brickmaker might, and he wagged his tail at the
pots, and he giv a sniff round and conveyed to me as he was used
to beer.&nbsp; So I draw&rsquo;d him a drop, and he drunk it
up.&nbsp; Next morning he come agen by the clock and I
draw&rsquo;d him a pint, and ever since he has took his pint
reg&rsquo;lar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On account of our birds, cats were not allowed in the house;
but from a friend in London I received a present of a white
kitten&mdash;Williamina&mdash;and she and her numerous offspring
had a happy home at &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
became a favorite with all the household, and showed particular
devotion to my father.&nbsp; I remember on one occasion when she
had presented us with a family of kittens, she selected a corner
of father&rsquo;s study for their home.&nbsp; She brought them
one by one from the kitchen and deposited them in her chosen
corner.&nbsp; My father called to me to remove them, saying <!--
page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>that he could not allow the kittens to remain in his
room.&nbsp; I did so, but Williamina brought them back again, one
by one.&nbsp; Again they were removed.&nbsp; The third time,
instead of putting them in the corner, she placed them all, and
herself beside them, at my father&rsquo;s feet, and gave him such
an imploring glance that he could resist no longer, and they were
allowed to remain.&nbsp; As the kittens grew older they became
more and more frolicsome, swarming up the curtains, playing about
on the writing table and scampering behind the book
shelves.&nbsp; But they were never complained of and lived
happily in the study until the time came for finding them other
homes.&nbsp; One of these kittens was kept, who, as he was quite
deaf, was left unnamed, and became known by the servants as
&ldquo;the master&rsquo;s cat,&rdquo; because of his devotion to
my father.&nbsp; He was always with him, and used to follow him
about the garden like a dog, and sit with him while he
wrote.&nbsp; One evening we were <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>all, except
father, going to a ball, and when we started, left &ldquo;the
master&rdquo; and his cat in the drawing-room together.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The master&rdquo; was reading at a small table, on which a
lighted candle was placed.&nbsp; Suddenly the candle went
out.&nbsp; My father, who was much interested in his book,
relighted the candle stroked the cat, who was looking at him
pathetically he noticed, and continued his reading.&nbsp; A few
minutes later, as the light became dim, he looked up just in time
to see puss deliberately put out the candle with his paw, and
then look appealingly toward him.&nbsp; This second and
unmistakable hint was not disregarded, and puss was given the
petting he craved.&nbsp; Father was full of this anecdote when
all met at breakfast the next morning.</p>
<p>Among our dogs were &ldquo;Turk&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Linda,&rdquo; the former a beautiful mastiff and the
latter a soft-eyed, gentle, good-tempered St. Bernard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mrs. Bouncer,&rdquo; a Pomeranian, came next, a tiny ball
of white fluffy fur, who came as a special gift to me, and
speedily <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>won her way by her grace and
daintiness into the affections of every member of the
household.&nbsp; My father became her special slave, and had a
peculiar voice for her&mdash;as he had for us, when we were
children&mdash;to which she would respond at once by running to
him from any part of the house when she heard his call.&nbsp; He
delighted to see her with the large dogs, with whom she gave
herself great airs, &ldquo;because,&rdquo; as he said, &ldquo;she
looks so preposterously small.&rdquo;&nbsp; A few years later
came &ldquo;Don,&rdquo; a Newfoundland, and then
&ldquo;Bumble,&rdquo; his son, named after &ldquo;Oliver
Twist&rsquo;s&rdquo; beadle, because of &ldquo;a peculiarly
pompous and overbearing manner he had of appearing to mount guard
over the yard when he was an absolute infant.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lastly
came &ldquo;Sultan,&rdquo; an Irish bloodhound, who had a bitter
experience with his life at &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo;&nbsp;
One evening, having broken his chain, he fell upon a little girl
who was passing and bit her so severely that my father considered
it necessary to have him shot, <!-- page 84--><a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>although this
decision cost him a great deal of sorrow.</p>
<p>For a short time I had the care of a mongrel called
&ldquo;Gipsy.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was not allowed to enter any of
the family rooms, and used to spend her time lying contentedly on
the rug outside the drawing-room.&nbsp; One afternoon a friend
came from Chatham bringing with him a wonderful poodle who had
been specially invited to perform all his tricks for my
father&rsquo;s enjoyment.&nbsp; On his arrival, &ldquo;Mrs.
Bouncer&rdquo; became furious, and when he began his tricks she
went deliberately into the hall and escorted &ldquo;Gipsy&rdquo;
into the drawing-room, as much as to say: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
stand this.&nbsp; If strange dogs are to be made much of, surely
the dogs in the house may be at least permitted to enter the
room.&rdquo;&nbsp; She would not look at &ldquo;Fosco,&rdquo; the
poodle, but sat throughout his performance with her back toward
him, the picture of offended dignity.&nbsp; Just as soon,
however, as he was fairly out of the house, <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>and not until
then, she escorted &ldquo;Gipsy&rdquo; back to her rug.&nbsp; My
father was intensely amused by this behaviour of
&ldquo;Bouncer&rsquo;s&rdquo; and delighted in telling this story
about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Bouncer&rdquo; was honored by many messages from
her master during his absences from home.&nbsp; Here is one
written as I was convalescing from a serious illness: &ldquo;In
my mind&rsquo;s eye I behold &lsquo;Mrs. Bouncer,&rsquo; still
with some traces of anxiety on her faithful countenance,
balancing herself a little unequally on her forelegs, pricking up
her ears with her head on one side, and slightly opening her
intellectual nostrils.&nbsp; I send my loving and respectful duty
to her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again: &ldquo;Think of my dreaming of
&lsquo;Mrs. Bouncer,&rsquo; each night!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My father&rsquo;s love for dogs led him into a strange
friendship during our stay at Boulogne.&nbsp; There lived in a
cottage on the street which led from our house to the town, a
cobbler who used to sit at his window working all day with his
dog&mdash;a Pomeranian&mdash;<!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>on the table
beside him.&nbsp; The cobbler, in whom my father became very much
interested because of the intelligence of his Pomeranian
companion, was taken ill, and for many months was unable to
work.&nbsp; My father writes: &ldquo;The cobbler has been ill
these many months.&nbsp; The little dog sits at the door so
unhappy and anxious to help that I every day expect to see him
beginning a pair of top boots.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another time father
writes in telling the history of this little animal: &ldquo;A
cobbler at Boulogne, who had the nicest of little dogs that
always sat in his sunny window watching him at his work, asked me
if I would bring the dog home as he couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay
the tax for him.&nbsp; The cobbler and the dog being both my
particular friends I complied.&nbsp; The cobbler parted with the
dog heartbroken.&nbsp; When the dog got home here, my man, like
an idiot as he is, tied him up and then untied him.&nbsp; The
moment the gate was open, the dog (on the very day after his
arrival) ran out.&nbsp; Next day Georgy and I saw him lying <!--
page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>all covered with mud, dead, outside the neighbouring
church.&nbsp; How am I ever to tell the cobbler?&nbsp; He is too
poor to come to England, so I feel that I must lie to him for
life, and say that the dog is fat and happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of horses and ponies we possessed but few during our
childhood, and these were not of very choice breed.&nbsp; I
remember, however, one pretty pony which was our delight, and
dear old &ldquo;Toby,&rdquo; the good sturdy horse which for many
years we used at &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; My father,
however, was very fond of horses, and I recall hearing him
comment on the strange fact that an animal &ldquo;so noble in its
qualities should be the cause of so much villainy.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Interest in London birds.&mdash;Our pet bird
&ldquo;Dick.&rdquo;&mdash;Devotion of his dogs.&mdash;Decision to
visit America.&mdash;His arrival in New York.&mdash;Comments on
American courtesies.&mdash;Farewell public appearances.</p>
<p>The warm affection which was so characteristic of my father
toward people was also directed, as I have already told, towards
animals and birds.&nbsp; A few further anecdotes occur to me, and
I have ventured to give them here, before proceeding to tell of
his visit to America, his readings, and the, to me, sad story of
his last public appearance.</p>
<p>My father&rsquo;s quick and amusing observation of London
birds and their habits, and of their fondness for &ldquo;low
company,&rdquo; is full of charm and quaint oddity.&nbsp; He
writes: &ldquo;That anything born of an egg and invested with
wings should have got to the pass that it hops contentedly down a
ladder into a cellar, and calls that going home, is a
circumstance so amazing <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>as to leave one nothing more in this
connection to wonder at.&nbsp; I know a low fellow, originally of
a good family from Dorking, who takes his whole establishment of
wives in single file in at the door of the jug department of a
disorderly tavern near the Haymarket, man&oelig;uvres them among
the company&rsquo;s legs, and emerges with them at the bottle
entrance, seldom in the season going to bed before two in the
morning.&nbsp; And thus he passes his life.&nbsp; But the family
I am best acquainted with reside in the densest part of Bethnal
Green.&nbsp; Their abstraction from the objects in which they
live, or rather their conviction that these objects have all come
into existence in express subservience to fowls, has so enchanted
me that I have made them the subject of many journeys at divers
hours.&nbsp; After careful observation of the two lords and of
the ten ladies of whom this family consists, I have come to the
conclusion that their opinions are represented by the leading
lord and leading lady, the latter, as I judge, an <!-- page
90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>aged
personage, afflicted with a paucity of feather and visibility of
quill that gives her the appearance of a bundle of office
pens.&nbsp; They look upon old shoes, wrecks of kettles,
saucepans and fragments of bonnets as a kind of meteoric
discharge for fowls to peck at.&nbsp; Gaslight comes quite as
natural to them as any other light; and I have more than a
suspicion that in the minds of the two lords, the early public
house at the corner has superseded the sun.&nbsp; They always
begin to crow when the public house shutters begin to be taken
down, and they salute the pot-boy the instant he appears to
perform that duty, as if he were Ph&oelig;bus in
person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During one of his walks through the slums, my father was so
fascinated by the intelligence of a busy goldfinch drawing water
for himself in his cage&mdash;he had other accomplishments as
well&mdash;that he went in and bought it.&nbsp; But not a thing
would the little bird do, not a trick would he perform when he
got to his new home in Doughty Street, and would only <!-- page
91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>draw
up water in the dark or when he thought no one was looking.&nbsp;
&ldquo;After an interval of futile and at length hopeless
expectation,&rdquo; my father writes, &ldquo;the merchant who had
educated him was appealed to.&nbsp; The merchant was a bow-legged
character, with a flat and cushiony nose, like the last new
strawberry.&nbsp; He wore a fur cap and shorts, and was of the
velveteen race velveteeny.&nbsp; He sent word that he would
&lsquo;look round.&rsquo;&nbsp; He looked round, appeared in the
doorway of the room, and slightly cocked up his evil eye at the
goldfinch.&nbsp; Instantly a raging thirst beset the bird, and
when it was appeased he still drew several unnecessary buckets of
water, leaping about the perch and sharpening his bill with
irrepressible satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While at Broadstairs one summer, our bathing woman, who reared
birds, gave a canary to my sister and myself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; who was only a few weeks old when he came to
us, grew to be a very king of birds, and became in time a most
important member of the household.&nbsp; <!-- page 92--><a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>There was a
fierce war waged against cats during his lifetime, and writing
from Boulogne my father very funnily describes our troubles with
the feline race: &ldquo;War is raging against two particularly
tigerish and fearful cats (from the mill, I suppose), which are
always glaring in dark corners after our wonderful little
&lsquo;Dick.&rsquo;&nbsp; Keeping the house open at all points it
is impossible to shut them out, and they hide themselves in the
most terrific manner, hanging themselves up behind draperies like
bats, and tumbling out in the dead of night with frightful
caterwaulings.&nbsp; Hereupon French, the footman, borrows a gun,
loads it to the muzzle, discharges it twice in vain, and throws
himself over with the recoil exactly like a clown.&nbsp; But at
last, while I was in town, he aims at the more amiable cat of the
two and shoots that animal dead.&nbsp; Insufferably elated by
this victory he is now engaged from morning to night in hiding
behind bushes to get aim at the other.&nbsp; He does nothing else
whatever.&nbsp; All the boys <!-- page 93--><a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>encourage him
and watch for the enemy, on whose appearance they give an alarm,
which immediately serves as a warning to the creature, who runs
away.&nbsp; They&mdash;the boys&mdash;are at this moment (ready
dressed for church) all lying on their stomachs in various parts
of the garden.&nbsp; I am afraid to go out lest I should be
shot.&nbsp; Mr. Plornish, says his prayers at night in a whisper
lest the cat should overhear him and take offence.&nbsp; The
tradesmen cry out as they come up the avenue: &lsquo;<i>Me
Voici</i>!&nbsp; <i>C&rsquo;est
Moi</i>&mdash;<i>boulanger</i>&mdash;<i>me tirez pas</i>,
<i>Monsieur Frenche</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; It is like living in a
state of siege, and the wonderful manner in which the cat
preserves the character of being the only person not much put out
by the intensity of this monomania is most ridiculous.&nbsp; The
finest thing is that immediately after I have heard the noble
sportsman blazing away at her in the garden in front I look out
of my room door into the drawing-room and am pretty sure to see
her coming in after the bird, in the calmest <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>manner
possible, by the back window.&rdquo;&nbsp; But no harm ever came
to &ldquo;our wonderful little &lsquo;Dick,&rsquo;&rdquo; who
lived to a ripe old age&mdash;sixteen years&mdash;and was buried
under a rose tree at &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On his return from his last visit to America he wrote a
charming account of his welcome home by the dogs at
&ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As you ask me about
the dogs, I begin with them.&nbsp; When I came down first I came
to Gravesend, five miles off.&nbsp; The two Newfoundland dogs
coming to meet me with the usual carriage and the usual driver,
and beholding me coming in my usual dress out at the usual door,
it struck me that their recollection of my having been absent for
any unusual time was at once cancelled.&nbsp; They behaved (they
are both young dogs) exactly in their usual manner, coming behind
the basket phaeton as we trotted along and lifting their heads to
have their ears pulled, a special attention which they received
from no one else.&nbsp; But when I drove into the stableyard,
&lsquo;Linda&rsquo; was <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>greatly excited; weeping profusely,
and throwing herself on her back that she might caress my foot
with her great forepaws.&nbsp; Mamie&rsquo;s little dog, too,
&lsquo;Mrs. Bouncer,&rsquo; barked in the greatest agitation on
being called down and asked: &lsquo;Who is this?&rsquo; tore
round me, like the dog in the Faust outlines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My father brought with him, on his return from his first visit
to America, a small, shaggy Havana spaniel, which had been given
to him and which he had named &ldquo;Timber Doodle.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He wrote of him: &ldquo;Little doggy improves rapidly and now
jumps over my stick at the word of command.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Timber,&rdquo; travelled with us in all our foreign
wanderings, and while at Albaro the poor little fellow had a most
unfortunate experience&mdash;an encounter of some duration with a
plague of fleas.&nbsp; Father writes: &ldquo;&lsquo;Timber&rsquo;
has had every hair upon his body cut off because of the fleas,
and he looks like the ghost of a drowned dog come out of a pond
after a week or so.&nbsp; It is very awful to see him sidle into
a room.&nbsp; He knows <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>the change upon him, and is always
turning-round and round to look for himself.&nbsp; I think
he&rsquo;ll die of grief; it is to be hoped that the hair will
grow again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For many years my father&rsquo;s public readings were an
important part of his life, and into their performance and
preparation he threw the best energy of his heart and soul,
practising and rehearsing at all times and places.&nbsp; The
meadow near our home was a favorite place, and people passing
through the lane, not knowing who he was, or what doing, must
have thought him a madman from his reciting and
gesticulation.&nbsp; The great success of these readings led to
many tempting offers from the United States, which, as time went
on, and we realized how much the fatigue of the readings together
with his other work were sapping his strength, we earnestly
opposed his even considering.&nbsp; However, after much
discussion and deliberation he wrote to me on September 28th,
1867: &ldquo;As I telegraphed after I saw you I am off to consult
<!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>with Mr. Forster and Dolby together.&nbsp; You shall
hear either on Monday or by Monday&rsquo;s post from London how I
decide finally.&rdquo;&nbsp; Three days later: &ldquo;You will
have had my telegram that I go to America.&nbsp; After a long
discussion with Forster and consideration of what is to be said
on both sides, I have decided to go through with it, and have
telegraphed &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to Boston.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was,
at first, some talk of my accompanying him, but when the
programme of the tour was submitted to my father and he saw how
much time must be devoted to business and how little, indeed
almost no time could be given to sightseeing, this idea was given
up.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A farewell banquet was given him in London on the second of
November, and on the ninth he sailed.&nbsp; A large party of us
went to Liverpool to see him sail, and with heavy hearts to bid
him farewell.&nbsp; In those days a journey to America was a
serious matter, and we felt in our hearts that he was about to
tax <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>his health and strength too cruelly.&nbsp; And so he
did.</p>
<p>Soon after reaching the United States, my father contracted a
severe cold which never left him during his visit, and which
caused him the greatest annoyance.&nbsp; I will give you a few
quotations from his letters to show how pluckily he fought
against his ailment and under what a strain he continued his
work.&nbsp; On his arrival at New York on Christmas Day, in
response to a letter of mine which awaited him there, he wrote:
&ldquo;I wanted your letter much, for I had a frightful cold
(English colds are nothing to those of this country) and was very
miserable.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds to this letter, a day or two
later: &ldquo;I managed to read last night but it was as much as
I could do.&nbsp; To-day I am so unwell that I have sent for a
doctor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again he writes: &ldquo;It likewise happens,
not seldom, that I am so dead beat when I come off the stage,
that they lay me down on a sofa after I have been washed and
dressed, and I lie there extremely faint for a quarter of an <!--
page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>hour.&nbsp; In that time I rally and come
right.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again: &ldquo;On the afternoon of my birthday
my catarrh was in such a state that Charles Sumner coming in at
five o&rsquo;clock and finding me covered with mustard poultices
and apparently voiceless, turned to Dolby and said:
&lsquo;Surely, Mr. Dolby, it is impossible that he can read
to-night.&rsquo;&nbsp; Says Dolby: &lsquo;Sir, I have told Mr.
Dickens so four times to-day and I have been very anxious.&nbsp;
But you have no idea how he will change when he gets to the
little table.&rsquo;&nbsp; After five minutes of the little table
I was not, for the time, even hoarse.&nbsp; The frequent
experience of this return of force when it is wanted saves me
much anxiety, but I am not at times without the nervous dread
that I may some day sink altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as a reward for his unstinted self-giving came the
wonderful success of his tour, the pride and delight which he
felt in the enthusiasm which greeted him everywhere, the personal
affection lavished upon him, and <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>the many
dear friends he made.&nbsp; He writes from Boston, <i>&agrave;
propos</i> of these rewards: &ldquo;When we reached here last
Saturday night we found that Mrs. Fields had not only garnished
the room with flowers, but also with holly (with real red
berries), and festoons of moss dependent from the looking-glasses
and picture-frames.&nbsp; The homely Christmas look of the place
quite affected us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, from Washington: &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help laughing
at myself on my birthday here; it was observed as much as though
I were a little boy.&nbsp; Flowers and garlands of the most
exquisite kind, arranged in all manner of green baskets, bloomed
over the room; letters, radiant with good wishes, poured
in.&nbsp; Also, by hands unknown, the hall at night was
decorated; and after &lsquo;Boots at the Holly Tree Inn&rsquo;
the audience rose, great people and all, standing and cheering
until I went back to the table and made them a little
speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrote home constantly, giving frequent commissions for
improvements at &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>Hill,&rdquo; to be made before his return.&nbsp; He was
much impressed on his second visit, as on his first, I remember,
with the beauty of the American women.&nbsp; &ldquo;The ladies
are remarkably handsome,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p101b.jpg">
<img alt="The Empty Chair" src="images/p101s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In the autumn of 1869 he began a series of farewell readings,
which were another heavy tax upon his health and strength.&nbsp;
During his tour at this time he writes to Mr. Forster after some
rather alarming symptoms had developed: &ldquo;I told Beard, a
year after the Staplehurst accident, that I was certain that my
heart had been fluttered and wanted a little helping.&nbsp; This
the stethoscope confirmed; and considering the immense exertion I
am undergoing, and the constant jarring of express trains, the
case seems to me quite intelligible.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say
anything in the &lsquo;Gad&rsquo;s&rsquo; direction about my
being a little out of sorts.&nbsp; I have broached the matter, of
course, but very lightly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even such warning as this failed to make him realize how
much less was his <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>strength, and with indomitable
courage and spirit he continued his tour.&nbsp; The trouble in
his feet increased, and his sufferings from this cause were very
great.&nbsp; It became necessary at one time for him to have a
physician in attendance upon him at every reading.&nbsp; But in
spite of his perseverance, he became so ill that the readings had
to be stopped.</p>

<p>My father gave his last reading in St. James&rsquo; Hall,
London, on the fifteenth of March.&nbsp; The programme included
&ldquo;The Christmas Carol&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Trial&rdquo;
from &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hall was packed by an
enormous audience, and he was greeted with all the warmth which
the personal affection felt for the reader inspired.&nbsp; We all
felt very anxious for him, fearing that the excitement and
emotion which must attend upon his public farewell would have a
bad effect upon him.&nbsp; But it had no immediate result, at any
rate, much to our relief.</p>
<p>I do not think that my father ever&mdash;and this is saying a
great deal&mdash;looked handsomer <!-- page 104--><a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>nor read
with more ability than on this, his last appearance.&nbsp; Mr.
Forster writes: &ldquo;The charm of his reading was at its height
when he shut the volume of &lsquo;Pickwick&rsquo; and spoke in
his own person.&nbsp; He said that for fifteen years he had been
reading his own books to audiences whose sensitive and kindly
recognition of them had given him instruction and enjoyment in
his art such as few men could have had; but that he nevertheless
thought it well now to retire upon older associations, and in
future to devote himself exclusively to the calling which first
made him known.&nbsp; &lsquo;In but two short weeks from this
time I hope that you may enter in your own homes on a new series
of readings, at which my assistance will be indispensable; but
from these garish lights I vanish now, for evermore, with a
heartfelt, grateful, respectful, affectionate
farewell.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a dead silence as my father turned away, much moved;
and then came from the audience such a burst and tumult <!-- page
105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>of
cheers and applause as were almost too much to bear, mixed as
they were with personal love and affection for the man before
them.&nbsp; He returned with us all to &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s
Hill,&rdquo; very happy and hopeful, under the temporary
improvement which the rest and peace of his home brought him, and
he settled down to his new book, &ldquo;Edwin Drood,&rdquo; with
increased pleasure and interest.</p>
<p>His last public appearances were in April.&nbsp; On the fifth
he took the chair at the News-venders&rsquo; dinner.&nbsp; On the
thirtieth he returned thanks for &ldquo;Literature&rdquo; at the
Royal Academy banquet.&nbsp; In this speech he alluded to the
death of his old friend, Mr. Daniel Maclise, winding up thus:
&ldquo;No artist, of whatsoever denomination, I make bold to say,
ever went to his rest leaving a golden memory more pure from
dross, or having devoted himself with a truer chivalry to the
art-goddess whom he worshipped.&rdquo;&nbsp; These words, with
the old, true, affectionate <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>ring in
them, were the last spoken by my father in public.</p>
<p>About 1865 my dear father&rsquo;s health began to give way, a
peculiar affection of the foot which frequently caused him the
greatest agony and suffering, appearing about this time.&nbsp;
Its real cause&mdash;overwork&mdash;was not suspected either by
his physicians or himself, his vitality seeming something which
could not wear out; but, although he was so active and full of
energy, he was never really strong, and found soon that he must
take more in the way of genuine recreation.&nbsp; He wrote me
from France about this time: &ldquo;Before I went away I had
certainly worked myself into a damaged state.&nbsp; But the
moment I got away I began, thank God, to get well.&nbsp; I hope
to profit from this experience, and to make future dashes from my
desk before I need them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was while on his way home after this trip that he was in
the terrible railroad accident to which he afterwards referred in
a <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>letter to a friend, saying, that his heart had never
been in good condition after that accident.&nbsp; It occurred on
the ninth of June, a date which five years later was the day of
his death.</p>
<p>He wrote describing his experiences: &ldquo;I was in the only
carriage which did not go over into the stream.&nbsp; It was
caught upon the turn by some of the ruin of the bridge, and
became suspended and balanced in an apparently impossible
manner.&nbsp; Two ladies were my fellow-passengers, an old one
and a young one.&nbsp; This is exactly what passed&mdash;you may
judge from it the length of our suspense: Suddenly we were off
the rail and beating the ground as the car of a half-emptied
balloon might.&nbsp; The old lady cried out &lsquo;My God!&rsquo;
and the young one screamed.&nbsp; I caught hold of them both (the
old lady sat opposite, and the young one on my left) and said:
&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t help ourselves, but we can be quiet and
composed.&nbsp; Pray, don&rsquo;t cry out!&rsquo;&nbsp; The old
lady immediately <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>answered: &lsquo;Thank you, rely
upon me.&nbsp; Upon my soul I will be quiet.&rsquo;&nbsp; We were
then all tilted down together in a corner of the carriage, which
then stopped.&nbsp; I said to them thereupon: &lsquo;You may be
sure nothing worse can happen; our danger must be over.&nbsp;
Will you remain here without stirring while I get out of the
window?&rsquo; They both answered quite collectedly
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and I got out without the least notion of what
had happened.&nbsp; Fortunately I got out with great caution, and
stood upon the step.&nbsp; Looking down I saw the bridge gone,
and nothing below me but the line of rail.&nbsp; Some people in
the other two compartments were madly trying to plunge out at a
window, and had no idea that there was an open, swampy field
fifteen feet down below them, and nothing else.&nbsp; The two
guards (one with his face cut) were running up and down on the
down-track of the bridge (which was not torn up) quite
wildly.&nbsp; I called out to them: &lsquo;Look at me!&nbsp; Do
stop an instant <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>and look at me, and tell me whether
you don&rsquo;t know me?&rsquo;&nbsp; One of them answered:
&lsquo;We know you very well, Mr. Dickens.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;my good fellow, for
God&rsquo;s sake, give me your key, and send one of those
laborers here, and I&rsquo;ll empty this carriage.&rsquo;&nbsp;
We did it quite safely, by means of a plank or two, and when it
was done I saw all the rest of the train, except the two baggage
vans, down the stream.&nbsp; I got into the carriage again for my
brandy flask, took off my travelling hat for a basin, climbed
down the brickwork, and filled my hat with water.&nbsp; Suddenly
I came upon a staggering man, covered with blood (I think he must
have been flung clean out of his carriage), with such a frightful
cut across the skull that I couldn&rsquo;t bear to look at
him.&nbsp; I poured some water over his face, and gave him some
to drink, then gave him some brandy, and laid him down on the
grass.</p>
<p>He said &lsquo;I am gone,&rsquo; and died afterwards.&nbsp;
Then I stumbled over a lady lying on her <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>back
against a little pollard tree, with the blood streaming over her
face (which was lead color) in a number of distinct little
streams from the head.&nbsp; I asked her if she could swallow a
little brandy, and she just nodded, and I gave her some and left
her for somebody else.&nbsp; The next time I passed her she was
dead.&nbsp; Then a man examined at the inquest yesterday (who
evidently had not the least remembrance of what really passed)
came running up to me and implored me to help him find his wife,
who was afterward found dead.&nbsp; No imagination can conceive
the ruin of the carriages, or the extraordinary weights under
which the people were lying, or the complications into which they
were twisted up among iron and wood, and mud and water.&nbsp; I
am keeping very quiet here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This letter was written from &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill&rdquo;
four days after the accident.&nbsp; We were spared any anxiety
about our father, as we did not hear of the accident until after
we were with <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>him in London.&nbsp; With his usual
care and thoughtfulness he had telegraphed to his friend Mr.
Wills, to summon us to town to meet him.&nbsp; The letter
continues: &ldquo;I have, I don&rsquo;t know what to call it,
constitutional (I suppose) presence of mind, and was not the
least fluttered at the time.&nbsp; I instantly remembered that I
had the MS. of a number with me, and clambered back into the
carriage for it.&nbsp; But in writing these scanty words of
recollection I feel the shake, and am obliged to stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We heard, afterwards, how helpful he had been at the time,
ministering to the dying!&nbsp; How calmly and tenderly he cared
for the suffering ones about him!</p>
<p>But he never recovered entirely from the shock.&nbsp; More
than a year later he writes: &ldquo;It is remarkable that my
watch (a special chronometer) has never gone quite correctly
since, and to this day there sometimes comes over me, on a
railway and in a hansom-cab, or any sort of conveyance, for a few
seconds, <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>a vague sense of dread that I have
no power to check.&nbsp; It comes and passes, but I cannot
prevent its coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have often seen this dread come upon him, and on one
occasion, which I especially recall, while we were on our way
from London to our little country station &ldquo;Higham,&rdquo;
where the carriage was to meet us, my father suddenly clutched
the arms of the railway carriage seat, while his face grew ashy
pale, and great drops of perspiration stood upon his forehead,
and though he tried hard to master the dread, it was so strong
that he had to leave the train at the next station.&nbsp; The
accident had left its impression upon the memory, and it was
destined never to be effaced.&nbsp; The hours spent upon
railroads were thereafter often hours of pain to him.&nbsp; I
realized this often while travelling with him, and no amount of
assurance could dispel the feeling.</p>
<p>Early in May of 1868, we had him safely back with us, greatly
strengthened and invigorated <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>by his
ocean journey home, and I think he was never happier at
&ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill&rdquo; than during his last two years
there.</p>
<p>During that time he had a succession of guests, and none were
more honored, nor more heartily welcomed, than his American
friends.&nbsp; The first of these to come, if I remember rightly,
was Mr. Longfellow, with his daughters.&nbsp; My father writes
describing a picnic which he gave them; &ldquo;I turned out a
couple of postilions in the old red jacket of the old Royal red
for our ride, and it was like a holiday ride in England fifty
years ago.&nbsp; Of course we went to look at the old houses in
Rochester, and the old Cathedral, and the old castle, and the
house for the six poor travellers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing can surpass the respect paid to Longfellow
here, from the Queen downward.&nbsp; He is everywhere received
and courted, and finds the working men at least as well
acquainted with his books as the classes socially above
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>Between the comings and goings of visitors there were
delightfully quiet evenings at home, spent during the summer in
our lovely porch, or walking about the garden, until &ldquo;tray
time,&rdquo; ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; When the cooler nights came
we had music in the drawing-room, and it is my happiness now to
remember on how many evenings I played and sang all his favorite
songs and tunes to my father during these last winters while he
would listen while he smoked or read, or, in his more usual
fashion, paced up and down the room.&nbsp; I never saw him more
peacefully contented than at these times.</p>
<p>There were always &ldquo;improvements&rdquo;&mdash;as my
father used to call his alterations&mdash;being made at
&ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill,&rdquo; and each improvement was supposed
to be the last.&nbsp; As each was completed, my sister&mdash;who
was always a constant visitor, and an exceptionally dear one to
my father&mdash;would have to come down and inspect, and as each
was displayed, my father would say to her most solemnly: <!--
page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>&ldquo;Now, Katie, you behold your parent&rsquo;s
latest and last achievement.&rdquo;&nbsp; These &ldquo;last
improvements&rdquo; became quite a joke between them.&nbsp; I
remember so well, on one such occasion, after the walls and doors
of the drawing-room had been lined with mirrors, my
sister&rsquo;s laughing speech to &ldquo;the master&rdquo;:
&ldquo;I believe papa, that when you become an angel your wings
will be made of looking-glass and your crown of scarlet
geraniums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here I would like to correct an error concerning
myself.&nbsp; I have been spoken of as my father&rsquo;s
&ldquo;favorite daughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; If he had a favorite
daughter&mdash;and I hope and believe that the one was as dear to
him as the other&mdash;my dear sister must claim that
honor.&nbsp; I say this ungrudgingly, for during those last two
years my father and I seemed to become more closely united, and I
know how deep was the affectionate intimacy at the time of his
death.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;last improvement&rdquo;&mdash;in truth, the very
last&mdash;was the building of a conservatory <!-- page 116--><a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>between the
drawing and dining rooms.&nbsp; My father was more delighted with
this than with any previous alteration, and it was certainly a
pretty addition to the quaint old villa.&nbsp; The ch&acirc;let,
too, which he used in summer as his study, was another favorite
spot at his favorite &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the early months of 1870 we moved up to London, as my
father had decided to give twelve farewell readings there.&nbsp;
He had the sanction of the late Sir Thomas Watson to this
undertaking, on condition that there should be no railway
journeys in connection with them.&nbsp; While we were in London
he made many private engagements, principally, I know, on my
account, as I was to be presented that spring.</p>
<p>During this last visit to London, my father was not, however,
in his usual health, and was so quickly and easily tired that a
great number of our engagements had to be cancelled.&nbsp; He
dined out very seldom, and I remember that on the last occasion
he attended a very large <!-- page 117--><a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>dinner
party the effort was too much for him, and before the gentlemen
returned to the drawing-room, he sent me a message begging me to
come to him at once, saying that he was in too great pain to
mount the stairs.&nbsp; No one who had watched him throughout the
dinner, seeing his bright, animated face, and listening to his
cheery conversation, could have imagined him to be suffering
acute pain.</p>
<p>He was at &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s Hill&rdquo; again by the
thirtieth of May, and soon hard at work upon &ldquo;Edwin
Drood.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although happy and contented, there was an
appearance of fatigue and weariness about him very unlike his
usual air of fresh activity.&nbsp; He was out with the dogs for
the last time on the afternoon of the sixth of June, when he
walked into Rochester for the &ldquo;Daily Mail.&rdquo;&nbsp; My
sister, who had come to see the latest &ldquo;improvement,&rdquo;
was visiting us, and was to take me with her to London on her
return, for a short visit.&nbsp; The conservatory&mdash;the
&ldquo;improvement&rdquo; which Katie had been summoned to
inspect&mdash;had been <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>stocked,
and by this time many of the plants were in full blossom.&nbsp;
Everything was at its brightest and I remember distinctly my
father&rsquo;s pleasure in showing my sister the beauties of his
&ldquo;improvement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had been having most lovely weather, and in consequence,
the outdoor plants were wonderfully forward in their bloom, my
father&rsquo;s favorite red geraniums making a blaze of color in
the front garden.&nbsp; The syringa shrubs filled the evening air
with sweetest fragrance as we sat in the porch and walked about
the garden on this last Sunday of our dear father&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; My aunt and I retired early and my dear sister sat
for a long while with my father while he spoke to her most
earnestly of his affairs.</p>
<p>As I have already said my father had such an intense dislike
for leave-taking that he always, when it was possible, shirked a
farewell, and we children, knowing this dislike, used only to
wave our hands or give him a silent kiss when parting.&nbsp; But
on this <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>Monday morning, the seventh, just as
we were about to start for London, my sister suddenly said:
&ldquo;I <i>must</i> say good-bye to papa,&rdquo; and hurried
over to the ch&acirc;let where he was busily writing.&nbsp; As a
rule when he was so occupied, my father would hold up his cheek
to be kissed, but this day he took my sister in his arms saying:
&ldquo;God bless you, Katie,&rdquo; and there, &ldquo;among the
branches of the trees, among the birds and butterflies and the
scent of flowers,&rdquo; she left him, never to look into his
eyes again.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, feeling fatigued, and not inclined to much
walking, he drove with my aunt into Cobham.&nbsp; There he left
the carriage and walked home through the park.&nbsp; After dinner
he remained seated in the dining-room, through the evening, as
from that room he could see the effect of some lighted Chinese
lanterns, which he had hung in the conservatory during the day,
and talked to my aunt about his great love for &ldquo;Gad&rsquo;s
Hill,&rdquo; his wish that his name might <!-- page 120--><a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>become more
associated with the place, and his desire to be buried near
it.</p>
<p>On the morning of the eighth he was in excellent spirits,
speaking of his book, at which he intended working through the
day and in which he was most intensely interested.&nbsp; He spent
a busy morning in the ch&acirc;let, and it must have been then
that he wrote that description of Rochester, which touched our
hearts when we read it for the first time after its writer lay
dead: &ldquo;Brilliant morning shines on the old city.&nbsp; Its
antiquities and ruins are surpassingly beautiful with the lusty
ivy gleaming in the sun and the rich trees waving in the balmy
air.&nbsp; Changes of glorious light from moving boughs, songs of
birds, scents from gardens, woods and fields, or rather, from the
one great garden of the whole cultivated island in its yielding
time, penetrate into the cathedral, subdue its earthly odor, and
preach the Resurrection and the Life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He returned to the house for luncheon, <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>seemingly
perfectly well and exceedingly cheerful and hopeful.&nbsp; He
smoked a cigar in his beloved conservatory, and went back to the
ch&acirc;let.&nbsp; When he came again to the house, about an
hour before the time fixed for an early dinner, he was tired,
silent and abstracted, but as this was a mood very usual to him
after a day of engrossing work, it caused no alarm nor surprise
to my aunt, who happened to be the only member of the family at
home.&nbsp; While awaiting dinner he wrote some letters in the
library and arranged some trifling business matters, with a view
to his departure for London the following morning.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was not until they were seated at the dinner-table that a
striking change in the color and expression of his face startled
my aunt.&nbsp; Upon her asking him if he were ill, he answered
&ldquo;Yes, very ill; I have been very ill for the last
hour.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when she said that she would send for a
physician he <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>stopped her, saying that he would go
on with dinner, and afterward to London.</p>
<p>He made an earnest effort to struggle against the seizure
which was fast coming over him, and continued to talk, but
incoherently and very indistinctly.&nbsp; It being now evident
that he was in a serious condition, my aunt begged him to go to
his room before she sent for medical aid.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come and
lie down,&rdquo; she entreated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, on the
ground,&rdquo; he answered indistinctly.&nbsp; These were the
last words that he uttered.&nbsp; As he spoke, he fell to the
floor.&nbsp; A couch was brought into the dining-room, on which
he was laid, a messenger was dispatched for the local physician,
telegrams were sent to all of us and to Mr. Beard.&nbsp; This was
at a few minutes after six o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I was dining at a
house some little distance from my sister&rsquo;s home.&nbsp;
Dinner was half over when I received a message that she wished to
speak to me.&nbsp; I found her in the hall with a change of dress
for me and a cab in waiting.&nbsp; Quickly <!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>I changed
my gown, and we began the short journey which brought us to our
so sadly-altered home.&nbsp; Our dear aunt was waiting for us at
the open door, and when I saw her face I think the last faint
hope died within me.</p>
<p>All through the night we watched him&mdash;my sister on one
side of the couch, my aunt on the other, and I keeping hot bricks
to the feet which nothing could warm, hoping and praying that he
might open his eyes and look at us, and know us once again.&nbsp;
But he never moved, never opened his eyes, never showed a sign of
consciousness through all the long night.&nbsp; On the afternoon
of the ninth the celebrated London physician, Dr. Russell
Reynolds, (recently deceased), was summoned to a consultation by
the two medical men in attendance, but he could only confirm
their hopeless verdict.&nbsp; Later, in the evening of this day,
at ten minutes past six, we saw a shudder pass over our dear
father, he heaved a deep sigh, a large tear rolled down his face
<!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>and at that instant his spirit left us.&nbsp; As we saw
the dark shadow pass from his face, leaving it so calm and
beautiful in the peace and majesty of death, I think there was
not one of us who would have wished, could we have had the power,
to recall his spirit to earth.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I made it my duty to guard the beloved body as long as it was
left to us.&nbsp; The room in which my dear father reposed for
the last time was bright with the beautiful fresh flowers which
were so abundant at this time of the year, and which our good
neighbours sent to us so frequently.&nbsp; The birds were singing
all about and the summer sun shone brilliantly.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And may there be no sadness of farewell<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I
embark.<br />
For though when from out our bourne of Time and Place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flood may
bear me far,<br />
I hope to see my Pilot face to face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I have
crossed the bar.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those exquisite lines of Lord Tennyson&rsquo;s <!-- page
125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>seem so appropriate to my father, to his dread of
good-byes, to his great and simple faith, that I have ventured to
quote them here.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the morning after he died, we received a very kind visit
from Sir John Millais, then Mr. Millais, R.A. and Mr. Woolner,
R.A.&nbsp; Sir John made a beautiful pencil drawing of my father,
and Mr. Woolner took a cast of his head, from which he afterwards
modelled a bust.&nbsp; The drawing belongs to my sister, and is
one of her greatest treasures.&nbsp; It is, like all Sir
John&rsquo;s drawings, most delicate and refined, and the
likeness absolutely faithful to what my father looked in
death.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>You remember that when he was describing the illustrations of
Little Nell&rsquo;s death-bed he wrote: &ldquo;I want it to
express the most beautiful repose and tranquillity, and to have
something of a happy look, if death can.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely this
was what his death-bed expressed&mdash;infinite happiness and
rest.</p>
<p><!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>As my father had expressed a wish to be buried in the
quiet little church-yard at Shorne, arrangements were made for
the interment to take place there.&nbsp; This intention was,
however, abandoned, in consequence of a request from the Dean and
chapter of Rochester Cathedral that his bones might repose
there.&nbsp; A grave was prepared and everything arranged when it
was made known to us, through Dean Stanley, that there was a
general and very earnest desire that he should find his last
resting-place in Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; To such a tribute to
our dear father&rsquo;s memory we could make no possible
objection, although it was with great regret that we relinquished
the plan to lay him in a spot so closely identified with his life
and works.</p>
<p>The only stipulation which was made in connection with the
burial at Westminster Abbey was that the clause in his will which
read: &ldquo;I emphatically direct that I be buried in an
inexpensive, unostentatious and <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>and
strictly private manner,&rdquo; should be strictly adhered to, as
it was.</p>
<p>At midday on the fourteenth of June a few friends and
ourselves saw our dear one laid to rest in the grand old
cathedral.&nbsp; Our small group in that vast edifice seemed to
make the beautiful words of our beautiful burial service even
more than usually solemn and touching.&nbsp; Later in the day,
and for many following days, hundreds of mourners flocked to the
open grave, and filled the deep vault with flowers.&nbsp; And
even after it was closed Dean Stanley wrote: &ldquo;There was a
constant pressure to the spot and many flowers were strewn upon
it by unknown hands, many tears shed from unknown
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p127b.jpg">
<img alt="Charles Dickens&rsquo; Grave" src="images/p127s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>And every year on the ninth of June and on Christmas day we
find other flowers strewn by other unknown hands on that spot so
sacred to us, as to all who knew and loved him.&nbsp; And every
year beautiful bright-coloured leaves are sent to us from across
<!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>the Atlantic, to be placed with our own flowers on that
dear grave; and it is twenty-six years now since my father
died!</p>
<p>And for his epitaph what better than my father&rsquo;s own
words:</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
